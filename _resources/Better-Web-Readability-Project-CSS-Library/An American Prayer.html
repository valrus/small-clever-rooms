	<h2>The Doors - An American Prayer </h2>
	
I<br />
<br />
Do you know the warm progress under the stars?<br />
Do you know we exist?<br />
Have you forgotten the keys to the Kingdom?<br />
Have you been borne yet &amp; are you alive?<br />
Let's reinvent the gods, all the myths of the ages<br />
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests<br />
[Have you forgotten the lessons of the ancient war]<br />
We need great golden copulations<br />
The fathers are cackling in trees of the forest<br />
Our mother is dead in the sea<br />
Do you know we are being led to slaughters by placid admirals<br />
&amp; that fat slow generals are getting obscene on young blood<br />
Do you know we are ruled by T.V.<br />
The moon is a dry blood beast<br />
Guerilla bands are rolling numbers in the next block of green vine<br />
amassing for warfare on innocent herdsmen who are just dying<br />
O great creator of being grant us one more hour to perform our art &amp; perfect our lives<br />
The moths &amp; atheists are doubly divine &amp; dying<br />
We live, we die &amp; death not ends it<br />
Journey we more into the Nightmare<br />
Cling to life our passion'd flower<br />
Cling to cunts &amp; cocks of despair<br />
We got our final vision by clap<br />
Columbus' groin got filled w/ green death<br />
(I touched her thigh &amp; death smiled)<br />
We have assembled inside this ancient &amp; insane theatre<br />
To propagate our lust for life &amp; flee the swarming wisdom of the streets<br />
The barns are stormed<br />
The windows kept &amp; only one of all the rest<br />
To dance &amp; save us<br />
W/ the divine mockery of words<br />
Music inflames temperament<br />
(When the true King's murderers are allowed to roam free a 1000 magicians arise in the land)<br />
Where are the feasts<br />
we were promised<br />
Where is the wine<br />
The New Wine<br />
(dying on the vine)<br />
resident mockery give us an hour for magic<br />
We of the purple glove<br />
We of the starling flight &amp; velvet hour<br />
We of arabic pleasure's breed<br />
We of sundome &amp; the night<br />
Give us a creed<br />
To believe<br />
A night of Lust<br />
Give us trust in<br />
The Night<br />
Give of color<br />
hundred hues<br />
a rich Mandala<br />
for me &amp; you &amp; for your silky pillowed house<br />
a head, wisdom &amp; a bed<br />
Troubled decree<br />
Resident mockery<br />
has claimed thee<br />
We used to believe in the good old days<br />
We still receive In little ways<br />
The Things of Kindness &amp; unsporting brow<br />
Forget &amp; allow<br />
Did you know freedom exists in a school book<br />
Did you know madmen are running our prison <br />
w/in a jail, w/in a gaol, w/in a white free protestant<br />
Maelstrom<br />
We're perched headlong<br />
on the edge of boredom<br />
We're reaching for death<br />
on the end of a candle<br />
We're trying for something<br />
That's already found us<br />
We can invent Kingdoms of our own<br />
grand purple thrones, those chairs of lust<br />
&amp; love we must, in beds of rust<br />
Steel doors lock in prisoner's screams<br />
&amp; muzak, AM, rocks their dreams<br />
No black men's pride to hoist the beams<br />
while mocking angels sift what seems<br />
To be a collage of magazine dust<br />
Scratched on foreheads of walls of trust<br />
This is just jail for those who must<br />
get up in the morning &amp; fight for such unusable standards<br />
while weeping maidens show-off penury &amp; pout ravings for a mad staff<br />
Wow, I'm sick of doubt<br />
Live in the light of certain<br />
South<br />
Cruel bindings<br />
The servants have the power dog-men &amp; their mean women<br />
pulling poor blankets over our sailors<br />
(&amp; where were you in our lean hour)<br />
Milking your moustache?<br />
or grinding a flower?<br />
I'm sick of dour faces<br />
Staring at me from the T.V.<br />
Tower. I want roses in my garden bower; dig?<br />
Royal babies, rubies must now replace aborted<br />
Strangers in the mud<br />
These mutants, blood-meal<br />
for the plant that's plowed<br />
They are waiting to take us into the severed garden<br />
Do you know how pale &amp; wanton thrillful<br />
comes death on strange hour <br />
unannounced, unplanned for like a scaring over-friendly guest you've brought to bed<br />
Death makes angels of us all &amp; gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws<br />
No more money, no more fancy dress<br />
This other Kingdom seems by far the best until its other jaw reveals incest &amp; loose obedience to a vegetable law<br />
I will not go<br />
Prefer a Feast of Friends<br />
To the Giant family<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
Great screaming Christ<br />
Upsy-daisy<br />
Lazy Mary will get you up upon a Sunday morning<br />
&quot;The movie will begin in 5 moments&quot;<br />
The mindless Voice announced<br />
&quot;All those unseated, will await The next show&quot;<br />
We filed slowly, languidly into the hall. The auditorium was vast, &amp; silent.<br />
As we seated &amp; were darkened<br />
The Voice continued:<br />
&quot;The program for this evening is not new. You have seen This entertainment thru &amp; thru.<br />
You've seen your birth, your life &amp; death; you might recall all of the rest<br />
-- (did you have a good world when you died?) -- enough to base a movie on?&quot;<br />
An iron chuckle rapped our minds like a fist.<br />
I'm getting out of here<br />
Where're you going?<br />
To the other side of the morning<br />
Please don't chase the clouds<br />
pagodas, temples<br />
Her cunt gripped him<br />
like a warm friendly hand.<br />
&quot;It's all right.<br />
All your friends are here.&quot;<br />
When can I meet them?<br />
&quot;After you've eaten&quot;<br />
I'm not hungry<br />
&quot;O, we meant beaten&quot;<br />
Silver stream, silvery scream,<br />
impossible concentration<br />
Here come the comedians<br />
look at them smile<br />
Watch them dance<br />
an indian mile<br />
Look at them gesture<br />
How aplomb<br />
So to gesture everyone<br />
Words dissemble<br />
Words be quick<br />
Words resemble walking sticks<br />
Plant them<br />
They will grow<br />
Watch them waver so<br />
I'll always be<br />
a word-man<br />
Better than a birdman<br />
But I'll charge<br />
Won't get away<br />
w/out lodging a dollar<br />
Shall I say it again<br />
aloud, you get the point<br />
No food w/out fuel's gain<br />
I'll be, the irish loud<br />
unleashed my beak<br />
at peak of powers<br />
O girl, unleash<br />
your worried comb<br />
O worried mind<br />
Sin in the fallen<br />
Backwoods by the blind<br />
She smells debt<br />
on my new collar<br />
Arrogant prose<br />
Tied in a network of fast quest<br />
Hence the obsession<br />
Its quick to admit<br />
Fats borrowed rhythm<br />
Woman came between them<br />
Women of the world unite<br />
Make the world safe<br />
For a scandalous life<br />
Hee Heee<br />
Cut your throat<br />
Life is a joke<br />
Your wife's in a moat<br />
The same boat<br />
Here comes the goat<br />
Blood Blood Blood Blood<br />
They're making a joke<br />
of our universe<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
Matchbox<br />
Are you more real than me<br />
I'll burn you, &amp; set you free<br />
Wept bitter tears<br />
Excessive courtesy<br />
I won't forget<br />
<br />
IV<br />
<br />
A hot sick lava flowed up,<br />
Rustling &amp; bubbling.<br />
The paper-face.<br />
Mirror-mask, I love you mirror.<br />
He had been brainwashed for 4 hrs.<br />
The LT. puzzled in again<br />
&quot;ready to talk&quot;<br />
&quot;No sir&quot; -- was all he'd say.<br />
Go back to the gym.<br />
Very peaceful<br />
Meditation<br />
Air base in the desert<br />
looking out venetian blinds<br />
a plane<br />
a desert flower<br />
cool cartoon<br />
The rest of the World<br />
is reckless &amp; dangerous<br />
Look at the<br />
brothels<br />
Stag films<br />
Exploration<br />
<br />
V<br />
<br />
A ship leaves port<br />
mean horse of another thicket<br />
wishbone of desire<br />
decry the metal fox
