	<h1>The Doors - Shaman's Blues</h1>
	
There will never be another one like you.<br />
There will never be another one<br />
Who can do the things you do, oh!<br />
Will you give another chance?<br />
Will you try, little try?<br />
Please stop and you'll remember<br />
We were together, anyway&hellip; All right!<br />
<br />
And if you have a certain evening<br />
You could lend to me,<br />
I'd give it all right back to you.<br />
Know how it has to be with you.<br />
I know your moves and your mind,<br />
And your mind, and your mind,<br />
And your mind, and your mind,<br />
And your mind, and you're mine!<br />
<br />
A-will you stop to think and wonder<br />
Just what you'll see<br />
Out on the trainyard nursing penitentiary?<br />
It's gone, I cry out long.<br />
<br />
Play it, brother.<br />
<br />
Did you stop it to consider how it will feel,<br />
Cold grindin' grizzly bear jaws hot on your heels?<br />
Do you often stop and whisper in Saturday's shore<br />
&quot;The whole world's a Savior?&quot;<br />
Who could ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever ask for more?<br />
Do you remember?<br />
Will you stop, will you stop the pain?<br />
<br />
And there will never be another one like you.<br />
There will never be another one<br />
Who can do the things you do, oh!<br />
Will you give another chance?<br />
Will you try a little try?<br />
Please stop and you'll remember<br />
We were together, anyway&hellip; All right!<br />
<br />
How you must of think and wondered,<br />
How I must feel<br />
Out on the meadows<br />
While you're on the field?<br />
I'm alone for you, and I cry.<br />
<br />
He's sweatin', look at him&hellip;<br />
Optical promise&hellip;<br />
(Heh, heh, heh.)<br />
You'll be dead and in hell before I'm born&hellip;<br />
Sure thing&hellip;<br />
Bridesmaid&hellip;<br />
The only solution &mdash;<br />
Isn't it amazing?
