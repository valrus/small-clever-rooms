<h2>Absinthes to Go Mad Over</h2>
<p>ABSINTHE? So devil may care, so deliciously disreputable, so ...  louche. But it&rsquo;s poisonous, no? It eats your brain and drives you crazy!If nothing else, a century of prohibition on absinthe gave it the sort of aura of dissolute glamour tha<span title="Lookup Word" id="nytd_selection_button"> </span>t  would-be brooding artists would drown their agents for. The two faces  of absinthe offered possibilities to idealists the world over,  searching for a muse or testing the limits of their risk-taking.</p>
<p>Consider  the cast of mythological absinthe drinkers: the vulnerable painter and  poet, too sensitive for this mean old world; the tormented soul, unable  to snap out of his self-loathing; the rakish hedonist, seeking one big,  lurid rush; the wealthy dilettante, dipping a toe in bohemia; and of  course, all manner of willing women. </p>
<p><img src="vino.jpg" /> But now absinthe is legal  again, and the romance of belle &eacute;poque naughtiness must give way to  what&rsquo;s in the glass. Pull over, you disillusioned dreamers: with no  laws to break, no frissons of danger, let the mystification stop right  now.</p>
<p>Since absinthe was legalized in the United States in 2007,  it has gone from forbidden fruit to virulent weed. Once smuggled from  Eastern Europe or procured from back-alley producers, absinthe is now  just another bottle on the bar. Yet mystique continues as marketing.</p>

<p>To  give absinthe its moment in the harsh light of day, the tasting panel  sampled 20 bottles. Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Audrey  Saunders, an owner of the Pegu Club on West Houston Street, and Pete  Wells, editor of the Dining section, who writes about drinks.</p>

<p>So  what makes absinthe absinthe? Essentially it is a neutral spirit  infused with myriad herbs and botanicals, centering around anise,  fennel and a specific type of wormwood, Artemisia absinthium, from  which absinthe takes its name. This wormwood contains small amounts of  thujone, a compound once thought to affect the mind. It&rsquo;s understood  now that hallucinations and other health issues attributed to  overindulging in absinthe were more a result of alcohol poisoning due  to the high alcohol content, typically 50 to 70 percent. </p>
<p>Few  things demystify absinthe more than the daunting prospect of 20 glasses  in front of you. For instance, all those nicknames &mdash; the green fairy,  the green muse, the green torment, the green oblivion &mdash; might lead one  to believe that absinthe is green, right? Often, but not always.</p>
<p>The  absinthes offered numerous variations on green, from pale celadon and  shimmering aquamarine to extra virgin olive oil to dizzyingly garish  shades that don&rsquo;t exist in nature outside of South Beach nightclubs.  But one absinthe was turquoise, which is near enough to green, I  suppose. Another was mouthwash blue. A few were completely clear. Those  were from Switzerland and included our favorite in the tasting, K&uuml;bler.  More on that soon enough.</p>
<p>What was plain to all of us was that absinthe, stripped of its mystique, can be wonderfully enjoyable but also confusing.</p>
<p>For  example, the ritual of service: the slow drip of water, from an Art  Nouveau fountain through a sugar cube held in a slotted spoon over the  glass, seeping down into a pool of green like sweetened tears. Oops,  again with the mystique.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important to know: forget  the sugar, remember the water. Despite the reverence today for vintage  bottles of pre-prohibition absinthe, much of what was produced back in  the old days was harsh and industrial. Sugar might have been a  necessary addition to make it palatable. The absinthes in our tasting  had enough natural (and possibly unnatural) sweetness that adding sugar  was unnecessary. The quality of most of them was unexpectedly good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  was surprised by how few lousy ones there were,&rdquo; said Pete, whose  experiences with contraband absinthes had not always been pleasant.</p>
<p> Without water, though, almost any absinthe would be difficult to  endure. Absinthe in general is simply too strong to drink undiluted. Of  our 20 bottles, 13 were 60 percent alcohol or more. Not only do they  require water, they require just the right amount, anywhere from three  to five parts water to one part absinthe, the amount rising &mdash; usually but not always &mdash; in tandem with the original strength of each bottle. </p>
<p>The best method, we found, was to begin with a three-to-one ratio, and  then, if the absinthe still tastes harsh, continue adding until a  seductive balance is achieved. With too little water, for example,  Lucid, No. 9 on our list, was hot and harsh at 62 percent alcohol. By  slowly adding more to achieve the right balance, the Lucid became  mellow and inviting.</p>
<p>Water not only changes the flavors, it almost magically alters the  appearance of the absinthe. As you slowly add water, the liquid in the  glass seems to thicken, and transforms into an opalescent pastel cloud.  The French call this effect the louche (which has the wonderful double  meaning of turbulent in French and disreputable in English).  Technically, when absinthe is distilled, the anise and fennel oils  dissolve into the alcohol. As the water dilutes the alcohol, it frees  the oils from their molecular prison, and they form a cloudy suspension.</p>
<p>The  louche effect occurs even with clear Swiss absinthes, like our No. 1,  K&uuml;bler, which turned a brilliant white in the glass. It offered rich,  warm anise and herbal flavors that were deliciously subtle rather than  greatly complex. </p>
<p>Among our top absinthes, the Grande Absente,  the Pernod and the &Eacute;mile Pernot Vieux Pontarlier all were beautifully  integrated, with balanced flavors centering on anise, licorice and  fennel, augmented by herbs and citrus. The next rank, particularly the  St. George &mdash; with a spider monkey on its label beating on a skull &mdash; and  the Jade Nouvelle-Orl&eacute;ans, offered greater complexity, with more  pronounced floral and herbal flavors, and less focus on anise. Absinthe  connoisseurs often seem to prefer these to the bottles that we favored.</p>
<p>One Swiss absinthe, Mansinthe, distilled to the specifications of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/marilyn_manson/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Marilyn Manson.">Marilyn Manson</a>, was not clear but a more common shade of green. Its brininess divided the panel. It was our No. 10.</p>
<p>I  mentioned that we had 20 absinthes in our tasting. Actually, we had 19,  with one absinthe substitute, Absente, which was distilled in France  using a different species of wormwood and marketed in the United States  during the ban. It&rsquo;s not absinthe, but we liked it very much,  particularly its iridescent louche and straightforward but rich anise  flavor. The same distiller now makes Grande Absente, an authentic  absinthe, which was our No. 2 bottle.</p>
<p>As appealing as we found  absinthe, we did not agree on its best role. Florence thought it would  be a good aperitif, like a pastis, which is made with anise substitutes  like Pernod or Ricard and blended with water to the same pearly result.  I disagreed, thinking that absinthe&rsquo;s herbal flavors made it a better  digestif, settling the stomach after a meal, like Chartreuse or amaro.  We all agreed that flaming absinthe cocktails are silly affectations.</p>
<p>While  a little absinthe can be quite pleasant, a lot, as with any other  strong spirit, will make you drunk. Perhaps, if you are of an <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/oscar_wilde/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Oscar Wilde.">Oscar Wilde</a> bent, too much absinthe will do to you what it did to him: &ldquo;After the  first glass, you see things as you wish they were,&rdquo; he said in one of  his many disquisitions on absinthe. &ldquo;After the second you see things as  they are not. Finally you see things as they really are, and that is  the most horrible thing in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer how martinis affected Dorothy Parker:</p>
<p>I like to have a martini,</p>
<p>Two at the very most.</p>
<p>After three I&rsquo;m under the table,</p>
<p>after four I&rsquo;m under my host.</p>
