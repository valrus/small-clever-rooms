<h2>‘Bunch of Guys on a Mission Movie’ </h2>
<p><img src="tarantino.jpg" /> &ldquo;THIS ain&rsquo;t your daddy&rsquo;s World War II movie,&rdquo; <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/113658/Quentin-Tarantino?inline=nyt-per" title="">Quentin Tarantino</a> said with a grin, standing on a street corner here that had been  scrubbed of 21st-century signposts to become the set of &ldquo;Inglourious  Basterds,&rdquo; his new film about a band of Jewish-American soldiers on a  scalp-hunting revenge quest against the Nazis.</p>
<p>Although it was  mostly shot at Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam, Germany, the movie&rsquo;s  subtitle is &ldquo;Once Upon a Time in Nazi-Occupied France.&rdquo; So on a  three-day sojourn in Paris in December, Mr. Tarantino and his  bi-continental moviemaking coalition commandeered a 1904 bistro with  peeling paint, Art Deco stained glass and a wall of windows overlooking  an intersection of identifiably Parisian streets in the 18th  Arrondissement.</p>
<p> &ldquo;We had to have a scene to sell the audience that we&rsquo;re in France,&rdquo; Mr. Tarantino said. &ldquo;This is it.&rdquo; </p>
<p> &ldquo;Inglourious Basterds,&rdquo; which is to have its premiere at the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/cannes_international_film_festival/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about the Cannes International Film Festival.">Cannes Film Festival</a> on May 20, is Mr. Tarantino&rsquo;s first movie since &ldquo;Death Proof,&rdquo; half of <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/gst/movies/titlelist.html?v_idlist=397299;327656&amp;inline=nyt_ttl">&ldquo;Grindhouse,&rdquo;</a> a double feature and box-office flop that he directed with <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/151002/Robert-Rodriguez?inline=nyt-per" title="">Robert Rodriguez</a>, and his first solo feature since <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/289932/Kill-Bill-Vol-2/overview">&ldquo;Kill Bill Vol. 2&rdquo;</a> in 2004. </p>
<p>Mr.  Tarantino calls &ldquo;Inglourious Basterds&rdquo; his &ldquo;bunch of guys on a mission  movie.&rdquo; Judging by the script, it should have the crackling dialogue,  irreverent humor and stylized violence that are hallmarks of his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  got to make a movie about something, and I&rsquo;m a film guy, so I think in  terms of genres,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So you get a good idea, and it just moves  forward and then usually by the time you&rsquo;re finished, it doesn&rsquo;t  resemble anything of what might have been the inspiration. It&rsquo;s simply  the spark that starts the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The spark that led to &ldquo;Inglourious Basterds,&rdquo; starring <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/56988/Brad-Pitt?inline=nyt-per" title="">Brad Pitt</a>, Diane Kruger, <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/person/51621/Mike-Myers?inline=nyt-per" title="">Mike Myers</a>,  Eli Roth and a large international cast, can be traced to Mr.  Tarantino&rsquo;s storied days as a video-store clerk in Manhattan Beach,  Calif. (The inspiration for <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/40984/Reservoir-Dogs/overview">&ldquo;Reservoir Dogs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jackie Brown&rdquo;</a> and other Tarantino movies can also be traced to that time.) </p>
<p> &ldquo;The guys at Video Archives were like, &lsquo;Quentin, maybe one of these  days you&rsquo;ll make your &lsquo;Inglorious Bastards,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Mr. Tarantino said,  referring to the (conventionally spelled) 1978 Enzo G. Castellari film.  &ldquo;But they hadn&rsquo;t even seen the movie, all right, it was just a great  title. I love the movie, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but it&rsquo;s not a remake,&rdquo; he  said, of his version. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be in the original category at the Oscars,&rdquo; he added optimistically. </p>
<p> Lawrence Bender, who has produced all but one Tarantino movie, said he  was surprised when Mr. Tarantino called last summer to announce he had  finalized the long-gestating &ldquo;Basterds&rdquo; script and wanted to finish the  movie in time for Cannes. Mr. Tarantino won the top prize there, the  Palme d&rsquo;Or, in 1994 for <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/131235/Pulp-Fiction/overview">&ldquo;Pulp Fiction.&rdquo;</a></p>
<p> &ldquo;He&rsquo;s read me all kinds of stuff over the years,&rdquo; Mr. Bender said, &ldquo;but  I always assumed it was something he was going to have and never do.&rdquo;  (Mr. Tarantino is known for taking plenty of detours on the way from  one movie to the next. He has directed episodes of television shows,  including &ldquo;CSI,&rdquo; acted in and produced other people&rsquo;s movies, and has  been a guest judge and &ldquo;mentor&rdquo; on &ldquo;<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/american_idol/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about American Idol.">American Idol</a>.&rdquo;)</p>
<p> A six-month research period for &ldquo;Basterds&rdquo; several years ago &ldquo;paralyzed  my writing for a while,&rdquo; Mr. Tarantino said. He thought of making a  World War II documentary or teaching a college course and even plotted  out a 12-hour mini-series. Then in January 2008 he said he decided to  &ldquo;take one more crack at seeing if I could make this a movie,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t out to teach a history lesson. You can turn on the History  Channel &mdash; which might as well be called the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/adolf_hitler/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Adolf Hitler.">Hitler</a> Channel. I just wanted to tell my story and have the same freedom I  would have telling any story. I want the act of writing to be so  fulfilling that I have to question do I want to even make the movie.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Mr. Tarantino&rsquo;s unedited script was circulating online within days  after he completed it. &ldquo;This was so personal to me, misspellings and  all,&rdquo; he said, mentioning that he had typed it with one finger on the  same 1987 Smith Corona word processor that he used to produce  &ldquo;Reservoir Dogs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pulp Fiction.&rdquo; &ldquo;I mean I&rsquo;ll proofread it when we  publish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Not that he&rsquo;ll change the title.  &ldquo;Basterds should be  spelled with an e,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It sounds like it has an e.&rdquo; He shouted,  &ldquo;Basterds! Basterds!&rdquo; in what sounded like a Boston accent: more  &ldquo;BAS-tids&rdquo; than &ldquo;BAS-terds.&rdquo; (As for the spelling of &ldquo;Inglourious,&rdquo; Mr.  Tarantino said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you stuff like that. It&rsquo;s a movie thing.&rdquo;)</p>
