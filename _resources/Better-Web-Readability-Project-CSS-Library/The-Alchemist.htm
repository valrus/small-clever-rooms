	<h1>The Alchemist</h1>
<p>
	At the highest point in Tarifa there is an old fort, built by the Moors. From
atop its walls, one can catch a glimpse of Africa. Melchizedek, the king of
Salem, sat on the wall of the fort that afternoon, and felt the levanter
blowing in his face. The sheep fidgeted nearby, uneasy with their new
owner and excited by so much change. All they wanted was food and water.
</p>
<p>
Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port.
He would never again see the boy, just as he had never seen Abraham
again after having charged him his one-tenth fee. That was his work.
</p>
<p>
The gods should not have desires, because they don't have destinies. But
the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful.
</p>
<p>
It's too bad that he's quickly going to forget my name, he thought. I should
have repeated it for him. Then when he spoke about me he would say that I
am Melchizedek, the king of Salem.
</p>
<p>
He looked to the skies, feeling a bit abashed, and said, "I know it's the
vanity of vanities, as you said, my Lord. But an old king sometimes has to
take some pride in himself."
