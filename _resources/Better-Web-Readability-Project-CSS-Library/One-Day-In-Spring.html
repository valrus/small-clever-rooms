<h3>One Day in Spring </h3>
<p>One day in spring, a woman came in my lonely woods, <br />
  in the lovely form of   the Beloved.<br />
  Came, to give to my songs, melodies,<br />
  to give to my dreams,   sweetness.<br />
  Suddenly a wild wave broke over my heart's shores and drowned all   language.<br />
  To my lips no name came.<br />
  She stood beneath the tree, turned,   glanced at my face, made sad with pain,<br />
  And with quick steps, came and sat by   me.<br />
  Taking my hands in hers, she said:<br />
  'You do not know me, nor I   you-<br />
  I wonder how this could be?'<br />
  I said:<br />
  'We two shall build, a bridge   for ever<br />
  between two beings, each to the other unknown,<br />
  this eager wonder   is at the heart of things.'<br />
  <br />
  The cry that is in my heart is also the cry   of her heart;<br />
  The thread with which she binds me binds her too.<br />
  Her have I   sought everywhere, her have I worshipped within me,<br />
  Hidden in that worship   she has sought me too.<br />
  Crossing the wide oceans, she came to steal my   heart,<br />
  She forgot to return, having lost her own.<br />
  Her own charms play   traitor to her,<br />
  She spreads her net, knowing not<br />
  Whether she will catch or   be caught. </p>
