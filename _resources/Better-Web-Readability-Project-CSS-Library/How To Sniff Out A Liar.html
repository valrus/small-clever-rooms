	<h1>How To Sniff Out A Liar</h1>
	
    <p>here are plenty of dangerously skilled liars--and not just the  Bernie Madoffs and Jeffrey Skillings of the world. Indeed, under the  right (or wrong) circumstances, we're all guilty fibbers. </p>
    <p>According  to an oft-cited 1996 University of Virginia study led by psychologist  Bella DePaulo, lying is part of the human condition. Over the course of  one week, DePaulo and her colleagues asked 147 participants, aged 18 to  71, to record in a diary all of their social interactions and all of  the lies they told during them. On average, each person lied just over  10 times, and only seven participants claimed to have been completely  honest</p>
    <p>To be fair, most of the time we're just trying to be nice. (When  your wife asks if you enjoyed the dinner she cooked, most husbands who  know what's good for them say, &quot;It was delicious.&quot;) Such &quot;false  positive&quot; lies are delivered 10 to 20 times more often than spurious  denials of culpability, according to DePaulo's research. Other studies  show that men and women lie with equal frequency, though women are more  likely to lie to make other people feel good, while men tend to lie to  make themselves look better. As for who we hoodwink, &quot;we lie less  frequently to our significant others because we're more invested in  those relationships,&quot; says Jeffrey Hancock, associate professor of  communication at <a href="http://topics.forbes.com/Cornell%20University" rel="nofollow">Cornell University</a>.</p>

    <p>The question is: How to know when someone's selling you swampland in Florida?</p>

    <p>Traditional polygraph tests, around in some form or fashion since the early 1900s, use sensors to detect fluctuations in <a href="http://topics.forbes.com/blood%20pressure" rel="nofollow">blood pressure</a>,  pulse, respiration and sweat in response to probing questions. Two  problems with polygraphs: First, they only work about 80% of the time,  according to the American Polygraph Association. Second, it's not like  we are going to carry all that hardware to a business meeting or a bar.  And that means relying on our own very limited vigilance.</p>
    <p>&quot;Although  there are some ways in which liars behave differently from  truth-tellers, there are no perfectly reliable cues to deception,&quot;  admits DePaulo, author of more than a dozen deception studies. &quot;Cues to  deception differ according to factors such as the type of lie and the  motivation for getting away with it.&quot;</p>
    <p>While there is no surefire on-the-spot way to sniff out dissemblers, there are some helpful tactics for uncovering untruths.</p>
    <p>Liars  often give short or one-word responses to questions, while truth  tellers are more likely to flesh out their answers. According to a 2003  study by DePaulo, a liar provides fewer details and uses fewer words  than an honest person, and talks for a smaller percentage of the  conversation. </p>
    <p>Skilled liars don't break a sweat, but the rest  of us get a little fidgety. Four possible giveaways: shifty eyes,  higher vocal pitch, perspiration and heavier breathing. Of course, not  everyone who doesn't meet your gaze is a liar.&quot;Certain behavioral traits, like averting eye contact, could be  cultural and not indicative of a liar,&quot; says Joseph Buckley, president  of John E. Reid &amp; Associates, which has provided interview and  interrogation training to more than 500,000 law enforcement agents to  date. The company is also the creator of the Reid Technique, a  nine-step interrogation process employed by many U.S. law enforcement  agencies.</p>
    <p>Liars are often reluctant to admit ordinary  storytelling mistakes. When honest people tell stories, they may  realize partway through that they left out some details and would  unselfconsciously backtrack to fill in holes. They also may realize a  previous statement wasn't quite right, and go back and explain further.  Liars, on the other hand, &quot;are worried that someone might catch them in  a lie and are reluctant to admit to such ordinary imperfections,&quot; says  DePaulo. </p>
    <p>Yet another clue: imprecise pronouns. To  psychologically distance themselves from a lie, people often pepper  their tales with second- and third-person pronouns like &quot;you,&quot; &quot;we&quot; and  &quot;they,&quot; says Hancock. Liars are also more likely to ask that questions  be repeated and begin responses with phrases like, &quot;to tell you the  truth,&quot; and &quot;to be perfectly honest,&quot; says Reid.</p>
    <p>When telling the  truth, people often make hand gestures to the rhythm of their speech.  Hands emphasize points or phrases--a natural and compelling technique  when they actually believe the points they're making. The less certain  will keep gesticulations in check, says Hancock.</p>
    <p>The mode of  communication matters too. Studies show that we are less likely to lie  face-to-face than over the phone or the Web. In one week-long study of  30 college students, Hancock observed that the phone was the weapon of  choice, enabling 37% of all the lies, versus 27% during face-to-face  exchanges, 21% using Instant Messaging and just 14% via e-mail.</p>
    <p>Will  we ever come clean? Not likely. Guilty stomach knots aside, the  subjects in DePaulo's study confessed that they would tell 75% of the  lies again if given the opportunity. Chances are, they'd get away with  it.</p>
