<h3>ANTICIPATIONS OF PERCEPTION </h3>
<p>
In all appearances, the real that is an object of sensation
has intensive magnitude, that is, a degree. </p>
<i>Proof</i> 
<p>
Perception is empirical consciousness, that is, a conscious-
ness in which sensation is to be found. Appearances, as objects
of perception, are not pure, merely formal, intuitions, like space
and time. For in and by themselves these latter cannot be per-
ceived. Appearances contain in addition to intuition the matter
for some object in general (whereby something existing in space
or time is represented); they contain, that is to say, the real
of sensation as merely subjective representation, which gives
us only the consciousness that the subject is affected, and
which we relate to an object in general. Now from empirical
consciousness to pure consciousness a graduated transition
is possible, the real in the former completely vanishing and a
merely formal <i>a priori</i> consciousness of the manifold in space
and time remaining. </p>
<i>The Anticipations of Perception</i> 
<p>
The principle which anticipates all perceptions, as such, is
as follows: In all appearances sensation, and the <i>real</i> which
corresponds to it in the object (<i>realitas phaenomenon</i>), has an
<i>intensive magnitude</i>, that is, a degree. </p>
<b>P 201</b><br />
Consequently there is also possible a<br />
<b>P 202</b><br />
<p>
synthesis in the process of generating the magnitude of a sen-
sation from its beginning in pure intuition = 0, up to any
required magnitude. Since, however, sensation is not in itself
an objective representation, and since neither the intuition
of space nor that of time is to be met with in it, its mag-
nitude is not extensive but <i>intensive</i>. This magnitude is
generated in the act of apprehension whereby the empirical
consciousness of it can in a certain time increase from nothing
= 0 to the given measure. Corresponding to this intensity
of sensation, an <i>intensive magnitude</i>, that is, a degree of
influence on the sense [<i>i.e.</i> on the special sense involved],
must be ascribed to all objects of perception, in so far as
the perception contains sensation. 
</p>
All knowledge by means of which I am enabled to know
and determine <i>a priori</i> what belongs to empirical knowledge
may be entitled an anticipation; and this is undoubtedly the
sense in which Epicurus employed the term <i>prolepsis</i>. But as
there is an element in the appearances (namely, sensation, the
matter of perception) which can never be known <i>a priori</i>, and
which therefore constitutes the distinctive difference between
empirical and <i>a priori</i> knowledge, it follows that sensation is
just that element which cannot be anticipated. On the other
hand, we might very well entitle the pure determinations in
space and time, in respect of shape as well as of magnitude,
anticipations of appearances, since they represent <i>a priori</i> that
which may always be given <i>a posteriori</i> in experience. If,
however, there is in every sensation, as sensation in general
(that is, without a particular sensation having to be given),
something that can be known <i>a priori</i>, this will, in a quite
especial sense, deserve to be named anticipation. For it does
indeed seem surprising that we should forestall experience,
precisely in that which concerns what is only to be obtained
through it, namely, its matter. Yet, none the less, such is
actually the case. 
Apprehension by means merely of sensation occupies only
an instant, if, that is, I do not take into account the succes-
sion of different sensations. As sensation is that element in<br />
<b>P 203</b><br />
the [field of] appearance the apprehension of which does not
involve a successive synthesis proceeding from parts to the
whole representation, it has no extensive magnitude. The
absence of sensation at that instant would involve the re-
presentation of the instant as empty, therefore as = 0. Now
what corresponds in empirical intuition to sensation is reality
(<i>realitas phaenomenon</i>); what corresponds to its absence is
negation = 0. Every sensation, however, is capable of diminu-
tion, so that it can decrease and gradually vanish. Between
reality in the [field of] appearance and negation there is there-
fore a continuity of many possible intermediate sensations,
the difference between any two of which is always smaller than
the difference between the given sensation and zero or com-
plete negation. In other words, the real in the [field of] ap-
pearance has always a magnitude. But since its apprehension
by means of mere sensation takes place in an instant and not
through successive synthesis of different sensations, and there-
fore does not proceed from the parts to the whole, the mag-
nitude is to be met with only in the apprehension. The real
has therefore magnitude, but not extensive magnitude. 
A magnitude which is apprehended only as unity, and
in which multiplicity can be represented only through ap-
proximation to negation = 0, I entitle an <i>intensive</i> magnitude. 
Every reality in the [field of] appearance has therefore inten-
sive magnitude or degree. If this reality is viewed as cause,
either of sensation or of some other reality in the [field of]
appearance, such as change, the degree of the reality as cause
is then entitled a moment, the moment of gravity. It is so
named for the reason that degree signifies only that magnitude
the apprehension of which is not successive, but instan-
taneous. This, however, I touch on only in passing; for with
causality I am not at present dealing. 
Every sensation, therefore, and likewise every reality in
the [field of] appearance, however small it may be, has a
degree, that is, an intensive magnitude which can always be
diminished. Between reality and negation there is a con-
tinuity of possible realities and of possible smaller perceptions. 
<b><br />
P 204</b><br />
Every colour, as for instance red, has a degree which, how-
ever small it may be, is never the smallest; and so with heat,
the moment of gravity, etc. 
The property of magnitudes by which no part of them is
the smallest possible, that is, by which no part is simple, is
called their continuity. Space and time are <i>quanta continua</i>,
because no part of them can be given save as enclosed between
limits (points or instants), and therefore only in such fashion
that this part is itself again a space or a time. Space therefore
consists solely of spaces, time solely of times. Points and instants
are only limits, that is, mere positions which limit space and
time. But positions always presuppose the intuitions which
they limit or are intended to limit; and out of mere positions,
viewed as constituents capable of being given prior to space
or time, neither space nor time can be constructed. Such mag-
nitudes may also be called <i>flowing</i>, since the synthesis of
productive imagination involved in their production is a pro-
gression in time, and the continuity of time is ordinarily
designated by the term flowing or flowing away. 
 All appearances, then, are continuous magnitudes, alike in
their intuition, as extensive, and in their mere perception
(sensation, and with it reality) as intensive. If the synthesis of
the manifold of appearance is interrupted, we have an aggre-
gate of different appearances, and not appearance as a genuine
quantum. Such an aggregate is not generated by continuing
without break productive synthesis of a certain kind, but
through repetition of an ever-ceasing synthesis. If I called
thirteen thalers a quantum of money, I should be correct, pro-
vided my intention is to state the value of a mark of fine silver. 
For this is a continuous magnitude in which no part is the
smallest, and in which every part can constitute a piece of coin
that always contains material for still smaller pieces. But if
I understand by the phrase thirteen round thalers, so many
coins, quite apart from the question of what their silver
standard may be, I then use the phrase, quantum of thalers,
inappropriately. It ought to be entitled an aggregate, that is,
a number of pieces of money. But as unity must be presup-
posed in all number, appearance as unity is a quantum, and
as a quantum is always a continum. 
<br />
<b>P 205<br />
</b>

Since all appearances, alike in their extensive and in their
intensive aspect, are thus continuous magnitudes, it might
seem to be an easy matter to prove with mathematical con-
clusiveness the proposition that all alteration (transition of a
thing from one state to another), is continuous. But the caus-
ality of an alteration in general, presupposing, as it does, em-
pirical principles, lies altogether outside the limits of a tran-
scendental philosophy. For upon the question as to whether
a cause capable of altering the state of a thing, that is, of
determining it to the opposite of a certain given state, may
be possible, the <i>a priori</i> understanding casts no light; and
this not merely because it has no insight into its possibility
(such insight is lacking to us in many other cases of <i>a priori</i>
knowledge), but because alterableness is to be met with
only in certain determinations of appearances, and because,
whereas [in fact] the cause of these determinations lies
in the unalterable, experience alone can teach what they are. 
Since in our present enquiry we have no data of which we
can make use save only the pure fundamental concepts of all
possible experience, in which there must be absolutely nothing
that is empirical, we cannot, without destroying the unity of
our system, anticipate general natural science, which is based
on certain primary experiences. 
At the same time, there is no lack of proofs of the great
value of our principle in enabling us to anticipate perceptions,
and even to some extent to make good their absence, by
placing a check upon all false inferences which might be
drawn from their absence. 
If all reality in perception has a degree, between which
and negation there exists an infinite gradation of ever smaller
degrees, and if every sense must likewise possess some par-
ticular degree of receptivity of sensations, no perception, and
consequently no experience, is possible that could prove,
either immediately or mediately (no matter how far-ranging
the reasoning may be), a complete absence of all reality in the
[field of] appearance. In other words, the proof of an empty
space or of an empty time can never be derived from experi-
ence. For, in the first place, the complete absence of reality<br />
<b>P 206<br />
</b>
from a sensible intuition can never be itself perceived; and,
secondly, there is no appearance whatsoever and no difference
in the degree of reality of any appearance from which it can
be inferred. It is not even legitimate to postulate it in order
to explain any difference. For even if the whole intuition of a
certain determinate space or time is real through and through,
that is, though no part of it is empty, none the less, since every
reality has its degree, which can diminish to nothing (the
void) through infinite gradations without in any way altering
the extensive magnitude of the appearance, there must be
infinite different degrees in which space and time may be filled. 
Intensive magnitude can in different appearances be smaller
or greater, although the extensive magnitude of the intuition
remains one and the same.<br /> 
 Let us give an example. Almost all natural philosophers,
observing -- partly by means of the moment of gravity or
weight, partly by means of the moment of opposition to other
matter in motion -- a great difference in the quantity of various
kinds of matter in bodies that have the same volume, unani-
mously conclude that this volume, which constitutes the ex-
tensive magnitude of the appearance, must in all material
bodies be empty in varying degrees. Who would ever have
dreamt of believing that these students of nature, most of
whom are occupied with problems in mathematics and
mechanics, would base such an inference solely on a meta-
physical presupposition -- the sort of assumption they so stoutly
profess to avoid? They assume that the real in space (I may
not here name it impenetrability or weight, since these are
empirical concepts) is everywhere uniform and varies only
in extensive magnitude, that is, in amount. Now to this pre-
supposition, for which they could find no support in experi-
ence, and which is therefore purely metaphysical, I oppose a
transcendental proof, which does not indeed explain the
difference in the filling of spaces, but completely destroys the
supposed necessity of the above presupposition, that the
difference is only to be explained on the assumption of empty
space. My proof has the merit at least of freeing the under-
standing, so that it is at liberty to think this difference in
some other manner, should it be found that some other
hypothesis is required for the explanation of the natural<br />
<b>P 207</b><br />
appearances. For we then recognise that although two equal
spaces can be completely filled with different kinds of matter,
so that there is no point in either where matter is not present,
nevertheless every reality has, while keeping its quality un-
changed, some specific degree (of resistance or weight) which
can, without diminution of its extensive magnitude or amount,
become smaller and smaller <i>in infinitum</i>, before it passes
into the void and [so] vanishes [out of existence]. Thus a
radiation which fills a space, as for instance heat, and
similarly every other reality in the [field of] appearance,
can diminish in its degree <i>in infinitum</i>, without leaving
the smallest part of this space in the least empty. It may
fill the space just as completely with these smaller degrees as
another appearance does with greater degrees. I do not at all
intend to assert that this is what actually occurs when material
bodies differ in specific gravity, but only to establish from a
principle of pure understanding that the nature of our per-
ceptions allows of such a mode of explanation, that we are
not justified in assuming the real in appearances to be uniform
in degree, differing only in aggregation and extensive magni-
tude, and that we are especially in error when we claim that
such interpretation can be based on an <i>a priori</i> principle of
the understanding. 
<br />
This anticipation of perception must always, however
appear somewhat strange to anyone trained in transcend-
ental reflection, and to any student of nature who by such
teaching has been trained to circumspection. The assertion
that the understanding anticipates such a synthetic principle,
ascribing a degree to all that is real in the appearances, and
so asserting the possibility of an internal distinction in sensa-
tion itself (abstraction being made of its empirical quality),
awakens doubts and difficulties. It is therefore a question
not unworthy of solution, how the understanding can thus in

<i>a priori</i> fashion pronounce synthetically upon appearances,
and can indeed anticipate in that which in itself is merely
empirical and concerns only sensation. 
The <i>quality</i> of sensation, as for instance in colours, taste,
etc. , is always merely empirical, and cannot be represented
<b><br />
P 208<br />
</b>
<i>a priori</i>. But the real, which corresponds to sensations in
general, as opposed to negation = 0, represents only that
something the very concept of which includes being, and
signifies nothing but the synthesis in an empirical conscious-
ness in general. Empirical consciousness can in inner sense
be raised from 0 to any higher degree, so that a certain ex-
tensive magnitude of intuition, as for instance of illuminated
surface, may excite as great a sensation as the combined
aggregate of many such surfaces has illuminated. [Since the
extensive magnitude of the appearance thus varies independ-
ently], we can completely abstract from it, and still represent
in the mere sensation in any one of its moments a synthesis
that advances uniformly from 0 to the given empirical con-
sciousness. Consequently, though all sensations as such are
given only <i>a posteriori</i>, their property of possessing a degree
can be known <i>a priori</i>. It is remarkable that of magnitudes
in general we can know <i>a priori</i> only a single <i>quality</i>, namely,
that of continuity, and that in all quality (the real in appear-
ances) we can know <i>a priori</i> nothing save [in regard to]
their intensive <i>quantity</i>, namely that they have degree. 
Everything else has to be left to experience.
