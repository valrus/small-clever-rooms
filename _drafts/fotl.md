title: Listening to Future of the Left in 2017
tags: [music, future of the left]
summary: On suddenly rediscovering the crunchiest, meanest rock band to make my top ten list since 2007.
---

I've been listening to Future of the Left again lately.
Future of the Left is a rock band fronted by Andrew "Falco" Falkous,
an Englishman who sing-speak-shouts sardonically
about (when I can discern his songs being "about" anything)
how most of what people think and get up to is idiotic shit.
He does so over raucous, aggressive guitar (and sometimes synthesizer) music,
with riffs and vocal rhythms that are ugly and crude
but stick inescapably in your head regardless.

I got pretty into Future of the Left's first album, _Curses_, which was released in 2007,
but after the novelty of my enjoing such a loud band[^loud] wore off,
the relentlessness of their contempt
was a little too much for my delicate constitution to sustain an interest in.
But, ten years on, I'm rediscovering them,
the four albums they've produced in the meantime,
and the four <strike>solo</strike> "one-man-band" albums
that Falco has _also_ released (as [Christian Fitness](https://christianfitness.bandcamp.com/)) in that time.

[^loud]:
  I think the last band that was this loud
  and that I also found this enjoyable
  was System of a Down,
  who though I suspect Falco would bristle at the comparison,
  did also resemble Future of the Left in their general lack of self-seriousness.

This is perfect music, in a way, for the era of Donald Trump[^america],
who has given (or perhaps merely revealed) to us
a raucous, aggressive, ugly and crude world
from which none of us can escape for long
and in which almost all of what people think and get up to,
in the highest echelons of American society, is idiotic shit.

[^america]:
  Excuse my America-centric read on this British-Isles-based music.
  I know Americans have a tendency to make everything about America.
  But Falco did record [a song about Trump](https://christianfitness.bandcamp.com/track/a-terrible-shame),
  so we share at least one unfortunate preoccupation.

Why do I need more of that in my leisure time?
Well, Future of the Left's music differs from real life in a few crucial ways.
It's _fun_, in a way that current international geopolitics is decidedly not.
Falco is an incredibly engaging frontman,
whose repertoire ranges from his distinctive "[white-noise scream](https://youtu.be/3HBDDgDElto?t=91),"
as memorably described in a music-discussion Facebook group I frequent,
to [BBC-announcer spoken word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuoPDUvkNqk)
to [some kind of military march/sea shanty pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAwliet2vqo)
to (very infrequently) [straight-up balladry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPZVjw75atU).
He sings only one note for two entire songs on their third LP _The Plot Against Common Sense_,
[Failed Olympic Bid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLoyj9EII2U)
and [A Guide to Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPojMNChY_E),
and they're among the best songs on the album.
He knows the value of an ad-lib,
and appreciates the fine distinction
between a freewheeling "YEAH!", a dignified "[YES!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIK5mUIOPfU)" and an unhinged "YAAAAAHHHHH!"
