title: Listening to Future of the Left in 2017
tags: [music, future of the left]
summary: On suddenly rediscovering the crunchiest, meanest rock band to make my top ten list since 2007.
---

I've been listening to Future of the Left again lately.
Future of the Left is a rock band fronted by Andrew "Falco" Falkous,
a Welshman who sing-speak-shouts extremely sardonically
about how most of what people think and get up to is idiotic shit.
He does so over raucous, aggressive guitar music,
with riffs, vocal rhythms and lyrics that are ugly and crude
but stick inescapably in your head regardless.

I got pretty into Future of the Left's first album, _Curses_, which was released in 2007,
but after the shock of the new (to me) wore off,
the relentlessness of their snarling contempt
was a little too much for my delicate constitution to sustain an interest in.
But, ten years on, I'm rediscovering them.
This is perfect music for the era of Donald Trump[^america],
who has given (or perhaps merely revealed) to us
a raucous, aggressive, ugly and crude world
from which none of us can escape for long
and in which almost all of what people get up to,
in the highest echelons of American society, is idiotic shit.

[^america]:
  Please excuse my America-centric read on this British-Isles-based music.
  I live here.

Why do I need more of that in my leisure time?

"Our survey says that shouting inanities in a regional accent is valuable to culture,"
shouts Falkous, inanely, in his regional accent
in "Singing of the Bonesaws."
And it is valuable to culture.
And it _is_ valuable to culture.
