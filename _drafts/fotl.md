I've been listening to Future of the Left again lately.
Future of the Left is a rock band fronted by Andrew Falkous,
a Welshman who sing-speaks extremely Welshly and sardonically
about how most of what people think and get up to is idiotic shit.
He does so over raucous, aggressive guitar music,
with riffs, vocal rhythms and lyrics that are ugly and crude
but stick inescapably in your head regardless.

This is perfect music for the era of Donald Trump,
who has given us a raucous, aggressive, ugly and crude world
from which none of us can escape for long
and in which almost all of what goes on is idiotic shit.

"Our survey says that shouting inanities in a regional accent is valuable to culture,"
shouts Falkous, inanely, in his regional accent
in "Singing of the Bonesaws."
And it is valuable to culture.
And it _is_ valuable to culture.
