title: A Different Kind of Freedom February
tags: [personal]
summary:

My employer Bonanza has an interesting employee benefit called "Freedom February,"
where during the aforementioned month
every employee gets a week's worth of free days off
and some cash to offset the cost of using those days
to take a tropical vacation should they desire to do so.
Generally, several months in advance,
employees decide on a few specific destinations
and those who want to travel with their co-workers
choose one from among them.

As a generally travel- and planning-averse person,
I opted for the easiest destination,
and then watched helplessly as it hemorrhaged people
until there were too few to make it worth the while
of anyone still nominally on board to plan.
That scheme having fallen through,
I resolved to use February to do some #adulting
and take care of some imposing tasks
that I otherwise foresaw myself putting off as long as possible.

The first of these was doing my taxes,
probably earlier in the year than any time in the last decade.
It was boring and this post will not mention it again.
The second was getting a vasectomy,
which I had "wanted" to do ever since I found out it was a thing
but been putting off for probably about fifteen years.
Doubts about whether I would change my mind and decide I actually wanted to have kids
were never what kept me from following through;
I'd gotten a mandatory pre-procedure consultation maybe four or five years ago
and then balked (and balked, and balked)
purely because of the small-scale practical considerations.

First among these considerations, from one perspective,
was the doctor at that consultation telling me
I wouldn't be able to bike after the procedure for _two to three weeks!_
Cycling is my primary way of getting around,
and this seemed like just an insurmountably style-cramping restriction on my mobility:
a big enough disruption to my normal life routine
to require significant planning around it.
But during Freedom February,
pretty much everyone who didn't zip off to a tropical paradise
at least works from home for most or all of the month.
So my excuse of having my commute borked was irrelevant.

With that excuse gone, though,
I saw the looming procedure from a new perspective:
one from which the previously insurmountable obstacle of negotiating transportation
seemed utterly trivial next to the real and imminent prospect
of having a complete stranger (1) focus their attention intensely
on my scrotum for a half hour and also (2) cut it and certain of its contents with a knife.
I have only recently become even mildly comfortable being seen naked
even in contexts like locker rooms where it's 100% standard,
so even the first part was going to take some getting used to,
to say nothing of the second.
But I knew if I gave myself _too_ much time to get used to it,
I would never get it done.

I guess that my ambivalence and anxiety about all this is not uncommon.
Insofar as I have a purpose in writing this,
it is to reassure any other bashful and anxiety-prone male-bodied people
who are considering getting a vasectomy
that while their anxiety about it isn't _exactly_ misplaced,
it's probably not as bad as they imagine or fear.

I decided to go to Planned Parenthood to have the procedure done,
because I believe they do important work
and I wanted any money that I (or my insurance) had to pay to go to them.
Having done so, I recommend them wholeheartedly.
Based on my experience, the whole process goes something like this:

## The consultation

Either because it had been years since my last consultation about it,
or because that consultation wasn't with Planned Parenthood,
I had to have another one.
The consultation is sort of like easy mode for the actual procedure.
There will be some rather frank discussion of your genitals
and what will be happening to them:
somewhat like a more intimate version of the reproduction part of your high school health class.
If you are a prude like me it will be somewhat uncomfortable,
but you're not in high school anymore, _thank fucking God_,
and everyone will actually be a grown-up,
which is good because they will also need to look at your penis.
This will probably be near the end of the consultation
and I guess it is to make sure there's nothing going on down there that would complicate the procedure?
I don't know. Possibly due to my own mild neuroses,
my theory is they're making sure that you're mentally prepared
to drop trou when a doctor tells you to,
because otherwise you're probably gonna have some difficulty
when the time for the actual vasectomy rolls around.

Speaking of which, if you finish the consultation and haven't changed your mind,
I recommend you schedule the procedure before you leave.
This will keep you from putting it off for another several years
and requiring another consultation later,
ultimately reducing the number of strangers who have to look at your penis by one.
These are the kind of optimizations that I,
as a now-seasoned vasectomy expert[^statistics],
can help you achieve.

[^statistics]:
  [Per 2015 statistics](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-men-in-us-dont-get-vasectomies),
  I am in approximately the top 10%
  of "married or in-union" American men in for number of vasectomies achieved,
  which makes me an expert by any reasonable definition.
  
## Pre-Procedure Preparation

In the interval between your consultation
and when you scheduled the actual vasectomy,
you will definitely not think or feel any anxiety about it,
so I'll proceed directly to the day of the main event.

You will have to arrange some transportation.
If you currently have a partner and they're available, look:
I'm not the boss of them or you,
but I think it would be _very_ reasonable
for them to be your chauffeur for the day.

At the consultation, they'll have told you to shower.
They might also have asked you to shave your scrotum.
My above claim to be an expert does not apply here,
but I can tell you that if you use a double-edge razor on your face,
you're in for an interesting experience.[^razor]
Just remember: unless you do something absolutely catastrophic,
any cuts you inflict on yourself will probably be shallower than the one you signed up for later today!

[^razor]:
  If you normally use a straight razor, you're in for an even more interesting one.

## The procedure

Before the procedure starts, someone will talk you through the process.
It will be more or less a rehash of what you were told in the consultation,
I guess _in case you forgot_ in the intervening time
that you're about to get your scrotum straight up cut open[^accuracy]
or that (equally importantly, in my opinion!) it will be anesthetized for the duration.
