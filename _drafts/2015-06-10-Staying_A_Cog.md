title: We Can't All Quit Our Jobs And That's Fine
summary: I'm not leaving the tech industry, but my feelings about it are as complicated as those of the people who are.

One of my favorite bloggers,
a person who goes by [eevee](http://eev.ee) on the internet,
just wrote [a post about leaving the tech industry](http://eev.ee/blog/2015/06/09/i-quit-the-tech-industry/).
Eevee has been in the industry —
most recently at Yelp —
for long enough that they're able to pay off their mortgage
and strike out on their own debt free.
Nevertheless, it's a gutsy move.
They freely admit they don't know how they're going to make money.
But for them, that uncertainty is worth not having to spend
what's unarguably a large proportion of their lives
solving someone else's largely redundant problems.

I've read several pieces of this kind by now.
Many seem to have an implied "...and you should too" at the end,
whether intentionally or no,
and some come right out and make that implication explicit.
So let's get the standard replies,
none of which I want this post to be a rehashing of,
out of the way:

- Sure, that's easy for *you* to say, Mr. Doesn't-Have-Student-Loans/Paid-Off-All-His-Debts/Made-A-Million-Cashing-In-Stock-Options! (Some people who write "Quit Your Job" posts are good at acknowledging the lucky circumstances that enabled them to have that option; others not so much. The people who come across as being the most smug about quitting their jobs are generally the ones who fail to recognize the enormous good fortune that enabled them to do so and seem to think it all came from their just being super awesome. But I do feel that anyone who wants to quit their job and has the opportunity to should go for it.)
- Cry more about your cushy office/telecommute job, Ms. First World Problems! There are people cleaning trash out of gutters for minimum wage right now! (Again, people who recognize the relative cushiness of their lucrative tech employment when explaining what about it causes them to quit tend to be less insufferable than those who fail to. Nevertheless, the system as a whole is still pretty broken and even the relatively comfortable tech industry is rife with legitimate issues of exploitation and soul-crushing bullshit.)
- Well, Mr. Special Snowflake Millennial, I'm glad you can *pursue your dreams* or whatever but some of us have *families* to support! (I understand where this kind of response is coming from but it reeks of bitterness. As I mentioned above, I think if someone has the opportunity to pursue their dreams, they damn well should, and rather than sniping at them—which I admit I've done plenty of myself in more informal venues than this one!—we'd be better directing our outrage at our broken system that keeps it from being an option for the vast majority of us.)

Basically I'm trying to avoid anything that smacks of resentment here.
Instead I want to work through a complicated feeling that I get
whenever I read a post like this.
It goes something like this.
First I cycle through some variation of all three of the responses listed above.
Then I think about how much I have in common with the author of the thing I just read.
It varies pretty widely, but some notable points are:
I'm not thrilled with my job, but I generally find it pretty interesting
and the result of it isn't something I feel bad about supporting.
I don't have a family, but I am supporting another person with my salary.
(This one is complicated a bit by the fact that that person
is ultimately trying to work for herself and, dare I say it, *pursue her dreams*
rather than be someone else's employee.)
But perhaps the biggest difference tends to be:
would I *want* to quit my job and have to find another way to support myself
and my partner?
I have a bunch of hobbies and side projects,
but the thought of having to work on any of them full time terrifies me;
having to make money from them even more so.
(And not in a fun, invigorating way.)
Even having to do the Network Legwork to like "market myself" as a freelancer
instead of an employee
seems like just a different —
and even less tolerable to me —
flavor of bullshit compared to the corporate setting I'm in now.
I'll admit it: I'm afraid of those other options
and staying at the job I have now is the obviously safe-feeling path.
But when I consider the alternatives more closely,
they don't feel like what I actually want.
And so I wonder how much my initial defensive reaction
is due to a cultural push for people in my relatively cushy position
to pursue our dreams or our bliss or self-actualize or whatever.
And I wonder if there are other people,
like me, made uneasy by what sometimes seems like an endless parade of admonishments
that we're not living up to their full potential
if we don't have big ambitions and follow them to the ends of the earth.
Personally, I don't have a lot of ambitions.
I want to do some work that I find interesting —
even if it means also doing some that I don't —
and maybe make some things that interest other people
and try to support people I believe in
and am well-positioned to support.

Another writer I like a lot, Kevin Fanning,
wrote a [nice piece](http://kfan.tumblr.com/post/45910246222/ok-by-now-youve-seen-this-article-in-the-onion)
that's a sort of rebuttal to the "pursue your dreams exclusively or be a failure" mindset.
It reinforces that it's okay to have a lot of different interests and goals
which may interfere or even outright conflict with each other,
and possible to find value in our lives
even if we're not doing what makes us blissful all the time.
I don't have big aspirations or ambitions:
I'm happy to maybe make some [music]({{ get_url('studio') }}) that a handful of people like,
