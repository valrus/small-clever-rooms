The best thing about him was always his purr.
It was loud, of course, a deep rumbling rich with the kind of reverberations
that make a purr really get into your marrow.
And he'd emit it at the slightest provocation,
for any of a number of reasons.
Often, you only needed to approach him
for that motor to start up.
You could wake him up from a nap
and he'd start to purr
even before he seemed to be fully aware of his surroundings.
