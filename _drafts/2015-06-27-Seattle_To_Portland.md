summary: A paean to Portland.
---

Once we emerge from the logjam of traffic that chokes Interstate 5 from Seattle to Olympia,
driving from Seattle to Portland becomes a kind of ritual:
a mantric succession of hieroglyphic road sign inscriptions and roadside attractions
both inscrutable and tacky.
Pe Ell.
Toledo Vader Road.
"Mattress Ranch."
The wrought iron retro-futuristic art installation with the Alaskan flag.
Kalama, the port town with the one main street parallel to the highway
and that Subway we've stopped at twice.
Sleater-Kinney Road.
The billboard reminding us in Gothic script that Christ died for our sins.
Vancouver (Washington, not British Columbia).
That final crossing of the drawbridge that marks the boundary of both Oregon State and, effectively, Portland itself.

Portland, land of local, raw goat milk and artisan honey,
where we've never had a single obligation
besides eating as much of the local bounty as possible without making ourselves sick
and meeting our friend at 8:45 a.m. sharp to be in line for [Tasty n Sons](http://www.tastynsons.com).
Every time we come down we talk about what it would be like to live here,
but I think we know that if we did, it wouldn't be what it is now:
a fantasyland where every inhabitant
is engaged in either the production of that aforementioned bounty
or the ongoing artistic struggle to "KEEP PORTLAND WEIRD"
as famously exhorted in paint near the site of the original, culturally microcosmic Voodoo Donuts.
When we only come down occasionally to absorb the sights and the food,
we can imagine it's all just for us.
Living here, having to work and pay bills
besides the ones we rack up in restaurants and bakeries and ice cream shops,
would shatter the illusion.
It's a solipsistic one, but if we can't indulge in a little solipsism when we're on vacation, when else?

Our most vexing problem —
though we carefully structure our Portland trips to avoid vexing problems —
is getting around.
We can do most of it on foot,
but longer distances require figuring out the serviceable public transport
or navigating the narrow neighborhood streets festooned with unexpected one-ways.
Worst of all is when we take to I-5 for our intra-city navigation,
with its labyrinthine tangle of on- and off-ramps around where it crosses the Willamette River,
where a couple wrong turns can send you five miles south of the city before you get a chance to turn back.

Average all these options together and you get the quintessential mode of Portland travel:
the bicycle, of course.
What else mixes the PDX ideals of DIY, eco-friendliness and hipster fashion so perfectly,
and at a pace that so deftly straddles the line between leisurely and hectic?
What other vehicle can navigate those narrow neighborhood streets so nimbly?
I confess that we haven't yet taken the step of bringing our own bikes down to Portland,
but we've spent so much time ogling the comprehensive network of bike lanes,
and the ubiquity of storefront bike racks, that it seems inevitable that we'll do so soon.

Unfortunately, Portland's not a universal utopia.
Its [history of racism](http://gizmodo.com/oregon-was-founded-as-a-racist-utopia-1539567040) is well-documented, and the resulting [segregation](http://stateofthereunion.com/portland-or-a-tale-of-two-cities/) is apparent today.
My whiteness is undoubtedly a big part of what makes Portland so comfortable for me;
the gentrified areas of it are basically [Stuff White People Like](http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/full-list-of-stuff-white-people-like/): The City,
and I am certainly guilty of liking a fair amount of Stuff White People Like.
So it's unfortunate that while Portland seems to have been made for people like me,
there was apparently considerable effort invested in making it *only* for people like me.
This post was only originally intended to be a paean to Portland,
but it seemed important also to acknowledge the exclusion that made it what it is.
(Of course, I'm sure my current home of Seattle is no great shakes in this area either.)

On my last trip to Portland,
my girlfriend and I spent a little time walking around,
talking about gentrification,
like you do.
What makes someone a gentrifier?
This [Slate quiz](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2015/07/gentrification_calculator_are_you_a_neighborhood_gentrifier.html) says you are if your income is much higher than the median where you live.
But [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification) defines gentrification thus:

> Gentrification is the buying and renovating of houses and stores in deteriorated urban neighborhoods by wealthier individuals, which in effect improves property values but also can displace low-income families and small businesses.

The Slate metric seems a bit crude to capture it completely,
but it's clear that if you satisfy Slate's definition
and you want to avoid Wikipedia's,
you need to work at it.

Anyway: Later, around 9 P.M., we went to get some ice cream.
We walked past a darkened porch from which someone said "Hello,"
and I turned to nod at the speaker but couldn't make out his face.
I assumed he was talking on a phone
and we continued.
"How're *you* doing," he said once we'd walked a little bit further,
and I got the uncomfortable feeling that he was actually talking to us,
but I didn't want to talk to a stranger in the dark at 9PM,
so we walked on.
Behind us we heard some indistinct muttering in which the words "rich people" were quite clear,
and then, even more clearly and quite loud, "*Fuck* you."

Then we went and spent $5 or whatever on a scoop of ice cream,
with me delivering petulant ripostes in my head the whole way:
No, fuck *you*, pal, for saying that shit to a total stranger!
Fuck *you*, jerk! I'm not rich! Go yell at some people who are actually rich!
Fuck *you*, asshole! I don't even goddamn live here!

But in the end, I had to face up to it:
*I* was the asshole who could take paid time off work to go to Portland
and spend the better part of an hour's salary at minimum wage
on an ice cream cone.
This guy was, apparently, a Portland native
whose offhand invective so perfectly encapsulated
the kind of simmering resentment
that I'd imagined might come from being priced out of your own neighborhood
that it seemed almost scripted.
But I swear to God it actually happened.

It was unsettling and it kind of cast a pall over the rest of the night,
but
