Content warning:
This blog post is about my experience as a white man
at a person-of-color-centric event
and my feelings during it.
If you are justifiably tired of white male navel-gazing
you may want to skip it.

I went to [this storytelling event called Tender Table](https://www.tendertable.com/),
described on its webpage as
"a storytelling platform featuring femmes of color and nonbinary people of color
and their stories about food, family, and identity."
I had just gone to my company's holiday party the previous night;
I like my coworkers and consider some of them friends, and I enjoyed it,
but it was loud, crowded and more than a little overwhelming.
Normally, I would try very hard to spend the whole next day recovering,
but my friend in Portland had texted me for the first time in 7 months
to tell me I should go to this thing,
and he's a man of discernment and taste.
So I went.
