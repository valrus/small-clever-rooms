Warning: This post will contain "spoilers" for the games Final Fantasy 7 and Final Fantasy 6,
though personally I see both of them as having passed their spoiler statute of limitations years ago.

There was a brief spasm of excitement in the gaming community recently
at the revelation that Square/Enix was planning to remake the classic JRPG Final Fantasy 7
and presumably bring the power of modern consoles to bear
on its now kind of embarrassingly outdated-looking graphics <sup id="ref1"><a href="#foot1" class="ref"></a></sup>.
But even though FF7 was probably the primary reason, at the time of its original release,
that my brother and I were begging our parents for a PlayStation rather than an N64,
I can't muster up much enthusiasm for that announcement now.

Instead, when I think about the few things that I remember from FF7<sup id="ref2"><a href="#foot2" class="ref"></a></sup>,
they just make me nostalgic for its predecessor,
the game that made me so excited for FF7 in the first place.
FF6 made the most of the Super Nintendo,
mustering a little cartridge's worth of space to leave far more of an impact on me 
than FF7 managed with three discs and a much better processor.

FF6 keeps its story manageable and its emotional core compelling
by focusing on its cast in the midst of its large-scale power struggles and central cataclysm.
The characters don't so much develop as unfold,
as the apocalypse frees them from the expectations of the old world
or uncovers<sup id="ref3"><a href="#foot3" class="ref"></a></sup> paths to some kind of peace
with their places in the new one or the various sorrows in their past.

<li class="foot" id="foot1">Admittedly, early PlayStation-era low-polygon 3D is not really in vogue right now.
Instead, the hot thing in indie games at the time of this writing is NES- or SNES-era pixel art in games.
It will be interesting to see if low-poly has its retro day in the sun too,
but it seems like enough time has passed since pixel art became popular in indie games
that if it were a cyclical/generational thing we'd have moved on to early-3D stuff by now.</li>
<li class="foot" id="foot2">Here are some things I remember from Final Fantasy 7:
<ul>
<li>Climbing like a hundred fucking flights of stairs in the Shinra Building.</li>
<li>The barest outlines of all the characters' personalities: Cloud, the Surly Ex-Soldier With The Spiky Hair and the Huge Sword.
Tifa, Cloud's Sweet And Kind Childhood Friend with the Boobs.
Barrett, The (Also Surly) Black Guy with the Gun Hand.
Aerith, The Sweet And Kind (And Bland) Magical Girl Who Gets Killed in That One Scene.
Cid, The (Also Surly) Airship Having Guy.
Yuffie, The Girl Who's Somehow A Ninja While Being Super Annoying.
Cait Sith, The Shitty Cat Robot Who Joins Your Party For Some Reason.
Vincent, The (Also Surly) Vampire Or Something?
Red XIII, The Native American Analogue Talking Dog Guy.</li>
<li>That famous scene where Sephiroth comes out of nowhere and kills Aerith.
Seriously, that's not a spoiler anymore, right? That can't possibly be a spoiler at this point.</li>
<li>"Materia." Some kind of... life energy? It manifested as blue swirly glowing stuff? And there was red stuff that was bad? Um... "Jenova?"</li>
<li>The characters' weird blocky hands in some of the more half-baked FMV.</li>
<li>The ultra-hard Emerald and Ruby Weapons and the Knights of the Round summon spell that took like a full minute to cast.</li>
</ul>
Here are some things I don't remember:
<ul>
<li>Why I was in the Shinra Building. What Shinra did besides ambiently be an Evil Bad Earth-Killing Corporation.</li>
<li>Why Sephiroth killed Aerith. Why I was supposed to care, since she had no personality that I can recall.</li>
<li>Any character's actual motivation or personality, for that matter.</li>
<li>What Materia is. What the central conflict of the game is. What Sephiroth wanted. What Jenova is.</li>
</ul></li>
