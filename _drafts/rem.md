I guess *Automatic for the People* just turned 25,
and as a result I'm doing that thing I do once in a while
where I compulsively hunt down and read things people have written about R.E.M.
There are so many of them[^writings] that I find something new every time I do this,
even though it's happened several times.

[^writings]:
  [Perfect Circle: An REM [sic] Story](https://www.avclub.com/tag/perfect-circle-an-rem-story).
  [Pop Songs 07-08](https://popsongs.wordpress.com/).
  [R.E.M. Singles Ranked](http://accordingtodoyle.com/2017/07/18/r-e-m-singles-ranked-81-86/).

A confession: the first R.E.M. album I ever listened to _with intent_ was _Up,_
and I didn't even buy it myself.
It was a birthday gift from my girlfriend at the time,
in probably my junior year of high school.

I say "with intent," though,
because I sort of never didn't listen to R.E.M.
_Murmur_ came out a few months after I was born,
and I don't know how long after that it took my parents
(who were both big R.E.M. fans by the time I was old enough to know what music was)
to have it in heavy rotation on our stereo.
I was actively a fan of Madonna and Suzanne Vega
by about the age of four,
but I don't remember being conscious of _Murmur_.
It was just part of our household's sonic DNA
to such an extent that after I realized I loved _Up_
and started delving into R.E.M.'s extensive back catalog,
when I rediscovered _Murmur_ I found that I already knew basically all of it by heart.
I don't know if it's possible to have this experience—to hear a piece of music "for the first time"
as a young adult and realize you remember it from
before you thought you had any conscious memories—without that music becoming
deeply important to you. So it is, in any case, with me and R.E.M.
