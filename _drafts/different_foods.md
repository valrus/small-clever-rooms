Red and green bell peppers are both _Capsicum annuum_:
red ones are just the riper version.

Pretty much every kind of tea is _Camellia sinensis_.
White tea, green tea, black tea, oolong, Darjeeling, whatever. You name it.
If it's not "herbal" tea or a "tisane" it's probably the same plant
and the only difference is how it was aged
and maybe whether it's the Chinese or Indian variety.

I knew that cremini mushrooms were just immature portobello mushrooms
due to some stores selling them as "Baby Bellas,"
but I didn't know that plain white or "button" mushrooms
were just even more immature creminis.
But they're all just _Agaricus bisporus_
at different points in their lifespans.
