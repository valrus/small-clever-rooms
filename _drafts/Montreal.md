## September 15, 2016

Tricked some unsuspecting Québecois into thinking I speak French today.
Now I'm relaxing in my hotel above a sex shop with hardwood floors and a kitchenette after walking like 12km today,
listening to the ruckus from the extremely hoppin' street outside.
I'm afraid to close the windows in case it doesn't actually significantly decrease the noise level.

I fooled exactly zero of the wily Québecois into thinking I spoke French;
they all saw through me effortlessly,
which probably means that actually the ones yesterday fooled ME into THINKING they thought I spoke French,
thereby winning a Princess Bride-esque battle of wits for which I was so wholly unprepared I didn't even know I was engaged in it.
Now I can only look back at the folly of my youth,
recently re-defined as "twenty-two hours ago" (down from about twenty-six),
and laugh bitterly.

Despite walking a possibly imprudent amount of "kilometres" yesterday and experiencing some knee pain at the end of the day,
I repeated my mistake today and am now having what's known as Entire Leg Pain.

That said, I did mitigate that by using the "metro" for much of my transportation,
enabling me to explore further afield while walking less!
Have you American hicks heard of this?
It's like a car, but it's on rails, only goes about fourteen places,
and doesn't kill tens of thousands of people every year.

I got a "Montréal style" bagel, which apparently means
"without cream cheese because they only sell cream cheese in tubs and you don't want to have to use one eighth of a tub of cream cheese and throw the rest away."
It was pretty good but could have used some cream cheese.

Speaking of being wholly unprepared for things,
which you may recall I mentioned in my first full paragraph so this is a legitimate "speaking of,"
I spent six hours at http://espacepourlavie.ca/en (as in the physical real-world location referred to by the URL there)
and it wasn't long enough for me to give even two of the three locations the attention they deserved.
I ended up with Looking At Things Fatigue to rival my Corporeal Fatigue,
and for that matter I'm coming down with a pretty severe case of Telling You Things Fatigue right now so that's it for tonight.
