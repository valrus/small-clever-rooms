me: depends how dank the memes are

2014-04-25 wow am I switching to emacs is this really happening

2014-05-23 Vim is 23 years old, emacs predates computers

2014-06-02 "Monadstic" yields no Haskell-related results on Google. Haskell programmers you need to step it the fuck up

2014-06-02 Oh Christ, not another fucking programming language.

2014-06-03 I'm a little disappointed how ugly and noisy the front page of http://t.co/dgMQ3a0zn7 is.

2014-06-11 Just confirmed that the back of the Nexus 4 is not, in fact, iterations of Conway's Game of Life and now I'm a bit disappointed.

2015-06-17 Just got a compliment from a manager on how productive I am this month but I don’t feel like I’m working that hard. I must be a 10x engineer

2015-07-11 I’m pretty sure I saw a t-shirt IRL today and then saw an ad for the same one on the internet later. This targeted ad shit has gone too far

2015-10-02 After reading comments on other sites #MetaFilter is like a refreshing blue minternet

2015-10-02 That tech people have dubbed this new dystopia the "sharing economy" just indicates that they don't actually know how sharing works

2015-11-05 Just wrote “all will be obscured by the obliterating penumbra of UNIX permissions” in a work doc, get at me

2016-01-05 GF is playing WoW with the speakers on and it turns out I’m extremely racist against gnomes

2016-09-23 Yes I have a Python module called "prescriptivism.py", yes it has a function to make a text list, yes it takes an "oxfordComma" keyword arg
2016-09-23 @Lagomorpho English prescriptivism, not Python prescriptivism (unfortunately the wrong name conventions were well in place before I started)

2017-01-05 The three hardest problems in software dev are cache invalidation, naming things, and escaping quotes and spaces in shell commands

2017-06-02 2 hardest problems in CS: naming things and seeing the @docker logo w/o wanting to smootch that whale on the top of his flat lil head

2017-08-23 C++ uses "else if". PHP, "elseif". Ruby uses "elsif", and Python uses "elif". What language will take the bold next step and use "elf"

2014-03-20 Been on a "Have One On Me" binge the last few days. Album holds up. Feel sorry for people who can't get past Joanna Newsom's voice.
2014-03-20 What are there, like, thirty thousand words in this thing? How can they all be so good?
2014-03-20 Having trouble with Have One On Me? Try reading @leighalexander's great series of essays http://t.co/QVIWJuvlG6
2014-03-20 @leighalexander I loved your take on California/Jackrabbits/Go Long especially. Have you seen http://t.co/36rG28iCTW ?
2014-03-20 Or for a course in Advanced Feminist Joanna Newsom Exegesis, try @systemofstrings's http://t.co/36rG28iCTW archive. A treasure trove!
2014-03-20 Here's a great, music-centric JN interview if you can get past the annoying fawning in the preamble: http://t.co/ro7pFMJH0G
2014-03-20 This concludes today's informational Twitter-seminar on Joanna Newsom.


2014-05-15 This presentation from a VP used the word "forevermore" on a PowerPoint slide.
2014-05-15 VP keeps referring to # of devices shipped "on Planet Earth." Dude if u want to feel like ur Making a Difference may I suggest philanthropy
2014-05-15 I wish I could share the diagram on this slide but I'll just say it seems to represent the Crawling Through an Air Duct Strategy
2014-05-15 How can you be at this level of a company and not know how to make a slide? What size is this font? 10pt?

2014-10-10 Uh oh, got a sassy bus driver. "Welcome to the bus," he said as I got on. 🚌
2014-10-10 "Next stop Madison, and that big thing there is the library. If you haven't seen it yet, I *highly* recommend it." 🚌
2014-10-10 "Next up we've got University Street. Home of the original University of Washington." Driver wanted to be a tour guide maybe? 🚌
2014-10-10 "I'd like to welcome you all to the 584 bus to Bellingham, Washington." (This is the 545 to Redmond and B'ham is 100 mi. north.) 🚌
2014-10-10 "Just kidding. Who's excited to go to Redmond? WOOOO!" Finger on the pulse of Seattle, this guy. 🚌
2014-10-10 I'm sorry, "Kyle." His name is Kyle. Kyle the Commuter Tour Bus Driver. 🚌
2014-10-11 "I want to be the first one to welcome you to Redmond, Washington. Smell that? ...That's the smell of freedom." 🚌
2014-10-11 "As we descend into Redmond, you can just feel the excitement building in the bus." Man, I picked the right day to forget my headphones. 🚌


2015-07-16 Listening to every #Weakerthans album I have seems like a good way to spend the rest of my work day http://t.co/9l5CT3YJqE
2015-07-16 Never much liked the production on #LeftAndLeaving but it has 3 of their best: Without Mythologies, title track, My Favorite Chords
2015-07-16 @KyleOrl hold the power button until it turns off
2015-07-16 I find all the #Weakerthans albums kind of inconsistent. To me, #ReconstructionSite is the strongest front-to-back
2015-07-16 The (trilogy) that runs through #ReconstructionSite is what really pulls it together as an album for me, but I love all 3 songs in it too
2015-07-16 Definitely think #ReconstructionSite is front loaded. (manifest), title track and of course the first Virtute song
2015-07-16 Last verse of "Reconstruction Site" (the song) is fucking perfect.
2015-07-16 "Comment allez-vous ce soir? Je suis comme-ci, comme-ca. Yes, a penguin taught me French back in Antarctica." 🐧
2015-07-16 "Time's Arrow" followed by the back masking in (hospital vespers) can't be a coincidence. This little song is heartbreaking
2015-07-16 C'mon Samson. Don't mangle the pronunciation of "again" to make it rhyme with "same." One of my biggest musical pet peeves
2015-07-16 "I hate Winnipeg" is the least of what makes "One Great City!" fantastic but it's a nice focal point for the verses' myriad indignities
2015-07-16 The percussion is so much more interesting on Reconstruction Site than Left and Leaving.
2015-07-16 (past-due) I find weakest of the (trilogy) but still a great ending. Did you notice they're all sonnets? #ReconstructionSite
2015-07-16 Ok, #ReunionTour. Let's do this
2015-07-16 "Civil Twilight" is a fine opener on a spotty album, paints an immaculate portrait of Total Ennui
2015-07-16 Between the icy roads and "the sun will start late and clock out early", first couple songs do a good job matching the cover's ice floes
2015-07-16 "Relative Surplus Value" makes it seem like the title "Reunion Tour" is really trying to evoke burned-out people dragging through
2015-07-16 Oh god, "Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure." Am I going to cry at work
2015-07-16 The repetition of "write off, no never ever never ever"  is just "prepare yourself for emotional A-bomb" to me now
2015-07-16 Oh god the bridge, fuck you John K. Samson you magnificent bastard
2015-07-16 I CAN'T REMEMBER THE SOUND THAT YOU FOUND FOR ME *sobs uncontrollably*
2015-07-16 Elegy for Gump Worsley is like a boring, bad Without Mythologies but after Virtute I need the come down
2015-07-16 Sun in an Empty Room is a pretty good song but I'm still worrying about Virtute
2015-07-16 "Bigfoot" has kind of a weird opaque backstory but has nice lines &amp; I think John K Samson generally works better over sparse instrumentation
2015-07-16 I don't hate the title track of #ReunionTour but it doesn't really go anywhere. I want to like "Utilities" more than I do.
2015-07-16 Basically I forgot how much my experience of #ReunionTour is dominated by the total emotional blowout of track 5
2015-07-16 Anyway this concludes my Weakerthans re-listen. In conclusion, listen to the Weakerthans and delete your Reddit account

2015-11-22 *goes to a mall and half the stores are closed cause it's too early* nice
2015-11-22 *hears Christmas music and immediately puts headphones in* niiiiiice
2015-11-22 I was going to walk around this mall and look at things but I can't I CAN'T ITS TOO CAPITALISM
2015-11-22 Though I guess that's at least slightly better than the straight up fascism I'm reading about on Twitter instead
2015-11-22 Some of the Undertale soundtrack could almost be Christmas music, actually, but I haven't been listening to it for 32 years so it's okay
2015-11-22 Holy shit this jewelry store has a Disney logo on it are they trying to sell upscale jewelry to kids who like Frozen
2015-11-22 Well, "Your Best Nightmare" just came on shuffle for maximum jarring consumerist disenchantment/paranoia, so much for "almost Xmas music"
2015-11-22 FUCK, THIS PLACE HAS A PUSHEEN PLUSHIE. I TAKE EVERYTHING BACK. CAPITALISM, I LOVE YOU
2015-11-22 I'm eating at a Big Bowl for the first time. This is so exciting, for a certain late capitalism soulless mall ennui definition of "exciting"
2015-11-22 Holy crap I think they're playing U2 in here. Like one of the recent albums? This is a real cultural education
2015-11-22 That Bowl was lowkey too Big actually

2016-09-30 Not a lot of that instrument where you wave your hand in the "Losing My Religion" band's oeuvre:
The R.E.M.: in there, min theremin.
2016-09-30 @KyleOrl because I figured out how to make a phrase consisting of the word "theremin" three times coherent by adding punctuation
2016-09-30 @KyleOrl I'm trying to push the boundaries of the language here, sometimes that means making an all-theremin sentence
2016-09-30 @KyleOrl I'm always looking for the next "Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo"
2016-09-30 @KyleOrl it makes sense to me as "Buffalo buffalo [that] Buffalo buffalo buffalo, [themselves] buffalo Buffalo buffalo."
2016-09-30 @KyleOrl and the vicious cycle of Buffalo buffaloing continues. Tragic, really
