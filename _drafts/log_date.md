summary: A paean to my favorite Steven Universe episode, and maybe my favorite eleven minutes of any television, period.

Warning: _Steven Universe_ seasons 1 and 2 spoilers ahead.
If you haven't watched _Steven Universe_, please consider it.
It is a phenomenal show.

I'm not generally good at playing favorites with things,
Goodness and enjoyment are multidimensional
and collapsing the vector of how much I enjoy something
down to a scalar in order to call it the "best"
isn't generally something I think can be done unambiguosly.
But in cases where I can pick out a favorite of something,
the factor that generally seems to make the most difference to me is _consistency_.
An album with a song that I always want to skip,
or one whose second half is noticeably weaker than the first,
probably won't be my AOTY.

I grin for all eleven minutes of "Log Date 7 15 2,"
the second season finale and my favorite episode of _Steven Universe_.
It ends season 2—as the world may or may not be on the brink of cataclysm—on a low-key, good-natured note[^finale],
revealing how a [face-turned](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn)
Peridot came to be on good terms with Garnet,
the stalwart center of the Crystal Gems.
In a clever framing device,
it takes the form of a bunch of flashback vignettes
as Steven, from whose point of view the show nominally never deviates,
listens to the logs she recorded on a hand-held tape recorder
that he gave her to help cope with being stranded on Earth.

[^finale]:
  I've read that Seasons 2 and 3
  were originally supposed to be one fifty-plus-episode mega-season like Season 1 was.
  This would explain why Season 2 ends in the relaxed way it does;
  Season 3 has much more of the big, eventful ending
  typical of TV shows these days.

I'm a sucker for concise, economical comedy,
and "Log Date 7 15 2" is 100% that.
But it's how it fits into the larger _Steven Universe_ story arc
that makes it more than just a solid run of great jokes and set pieces,
shoring up the places it's weakest
and elevating its finest moments even further.
Though the comedic timing is perfect,
Peridot's pushing Greg off the roof is telegraphed about a million miles out
by her pondering the flight capabilities of Earth creatures.
But the real payoff is in Garnet's thoughtful reaction
to Peridot's indignant "How was I supposed to know that?"
