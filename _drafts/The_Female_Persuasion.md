title: I Read _The Female Persuasion_, by Meg Wolitzer
tags: []
summary: The story and characters were gripping enough that I put off thinking about what I didn't like until afterwards.

I haven't been reading all that much this year,
though I'm trying to get back into it.
If every book I picked up on a whim from my local library
were as compelling and readable as Meg Wolitzer's _The Female Persuasion_,
I'd probably have an easier time of it.

_The Female Persuasion_'s 450 or so pages focus on a tidy cast of four characters,
all well-rendered and mostly sympathetic.
College-bound, bookish Greer is the protagonist mostly by virtue of having the most page time,
but I found her to be the least interesting of the four main characters.
She's likable and earnest in her desire to do good,
