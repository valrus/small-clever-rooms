# Roguelight

â€‹It's only a roguelike in the same way Rogue Legacy is a roguelike but it's damn economical and clever: two actions you can take, two kinds of enemies you can encounter, and you go down, and that's it.

Before I scored enough of the upgrades to make scarcity less of a concern (and once you have them all, this game is maybe a little too easy), there were some frustrating moments. When the RNG throws a convoluted route at you it's easy to run out of arrows trying to find your way down, and at that point your options are basically give up or stumble around in total darkness until you find either some new arrows or death.

It took a while before my main concern was running out of life rather than running out of arrows, but that probably means I didn't strategize my upgrades very well; I basically used a greedy algorithm so I'd be throwing away as little money as possible. Might be better to waste a little more money and get more arrows sooner.
