title: My Mouth
---

My mouth is set in the usual place:  
three quarters of the way down my face.  

My mouth will lie to you.  
And you won't know that what I'm saying isn't true.  
You might believe me when I say that bad things always end okay,  
but actually I'm not sure that they do.  

My mouth will devour everything you're scared of in a quarter of an hour.  
Even though the taste is sour, all the awful things you saw  
disappear in fifteen minutes down into my gaping maw!  

My mouth will always kiss you, I swear;  
even though you know as well as me what just went in there.  
While my lips are in your hair, I will take your awful truths  
and turn them into something we can use.
