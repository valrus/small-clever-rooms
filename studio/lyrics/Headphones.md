I'm so self conscious, even though I know that it's nonsense.  
It's only part of the process to just mess around.  

But I'm gonna hide out and use up my white out;  
'till I'm rid of my doubt, you won't hear a sound.  

What am I afraid of?  
Is it the blood and guts that I'm made of?  
And if I'm laying them all out before you...  
and it bores you?  

It's not a remedy to arrange my brains to a melody,  
if I guard it so very jealously that it never gets a chance to breathe.  

But you don't need to tell me it's okay, or maybe you do.  
And I don't want to believe I'm scared of you, but maybe it's true.  
Maybe I don't want to get past this.  
In practice, maybe all I want is an ass-kiss.  
But I don't know.  

Or maybe it's my own brain that makes me just want to be alone,  
and keeps me smooth and seamless as a stone,  
as you try to break me out in vain.  

Well, it's nauseous.  
And I finally decide to just cut my losses.  
I pour it out in the sink and turn on the faucets,  
until not even a trace remains.
