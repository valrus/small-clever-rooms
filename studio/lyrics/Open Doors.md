title: Open Doors
---

Sometimes, I can't tell if the thrum within the hand I'm resting lightly on your chest is coming from my heart or you.  
There are gently ringing bells, a subtle tintinnabulation from a waft of patient air through heavy doors so rarely used  
or even opened  
that the hinges rusted through.  

I wanted information, but the sweetness of the questions that your breathing raises in me only wipes away the things I thought I knew.  
No invocation or memory potion can assist me now, so I'm left with only mysteries that whisper in the quiet room.  
And outside all your flowers are in bloom.
