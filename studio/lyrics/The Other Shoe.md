title: The Other Shoe
---

Something awful's gonna happen to me,  
I don't know if I'm gonna be ready for it.  
'Cause fortune swings like a pendulum in a clock  
about to upend and knock me into a deep pit.  
So I know that trouble brews,  
but I don't know when or why or how or much less what I'll do.  
So I just hope for subtle clues  
as I shudder in my shoes and wait for the bloody news, and I wonder:  
What'll it be?  
When's it gonna hit me?  
And why does it seem like my mind can never get free?  

It all started last week when I had a windfall.  
I gave it all to charity to try to forestall  
the other shoe dropping like a medicine ball on my skull!  
I think the world is ready to pour all its troubles upon me,  
but it's not like I'm Gandhi,  
who can bear the weight of so heavy a fate!  
I hate the feeling good graces only mean I'm in trouble now.  
When life is dealing aces I'm scared to double down.  
It's unappealing how my face is locked in a subtle frown,  
I'm thinking about peeling out for new places or another town.  
But I can't evade it!  
If the piper wants a bribe it's too high to have paid it.  
But I've made it through this kind of cycle often before.  
The hard heart of life'll soften and even the score.  
So I stifle coughing and it's into the breach once more:  
the dice'll drop and then, my friends, I will know what is in store.  

OK.  

Something's always going to happen to me,  
I don't know if I'll ever be ready for it.   
But fortune springs right back when it smacks me down:  
before it's back around, it always lets me rally a little bit.
