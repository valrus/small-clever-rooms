title: Where No One Has Gone Before
---

Light up what I reveal to no one else.  
My trust, I deny even myself.  
Cause I'm a man, and men don't hurt like this, I hear!  
But you can dig through the dust to find the fears  
between my ears, behind my face: the final frontier.  

I'm always honest, except for with my own stone heart.  
I might admonish, but don't don't don't don't let's start.  
They might be giant expectations stifling me.  
But I'm defiant; whether that's enough we'll see before long.  

My crisis finding mind will put my feelings on the line.  
I have no sure way to divine which thoughts invade and which are mine,  
or if it is even well-defined.  
Lend me your ears, I'll grow a spine.  
In this cathartic pantomime,  

I'm the android who learns how to hold someone's hand  
behind obsidian walls that just crumble to sand.  
And you make me a space where I let down my guard.  
And we discover that touching bare wires is hard.  
But we can do it!  

I need to argue;  
I need to roll down in the muck.  
Don't want to harm you;  
it's just my instinct when I get stuck inside my own head.  
Like every man I've ever known, I'm fucking damaged  
by learning I should stay alone with my thoughts  
you pry out one by one.  
Precisely what I needed done.  
I can't quite say that this is fun,  
but: I don't have my wisdom teeth either.  
So take me off the Goddamn ether!
