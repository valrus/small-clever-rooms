## Five Albums I Loved, In Roughly Chronological (for me) Order

### Owen Pallett, *In Conflict*. [▶](http://alpentine.com/discography/in-conflict) <a href="{{ get_asset('images/covers2014/In Conflict.jpg')|urlencode }}" title="In Conflict album cover"rel="bytebox"><img class="albumcover" src="{{ get_asset('images/covers2014/In Conflict.jpg')|urlencode }}" title="In Conflict album cover" /></a>

["In Conflict"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoDlU9A6y50). ["The Riverbed"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt8wR8CagQo). ["On a Path"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMr51844ybw).

I think Owen Pallett is one of those musicians who hits a stride and then just can do no wrong for like a decade or so, and *In Conflict* finds him in the middle of that stride. His musical inventory has grown from the looped violin and chamber strings of his earlier albums to more fully incorporate acoustic drums and the electronic and synth flourishes he started employing on *Heartland*.

Pallett's voice, never the kind to dominate a track, still doesn't, but it's stronger than ever, easily centering the driving, intense "The Riverbed" (shot through with electric guitar, surely his loudest song) and making "The world will forget any good you have done" sound like a rallying cry. But more often, especially before the first of his two "→” interludes, it's gentle like on "The Passions," where it floats over strings that drift from abstract tone clusters (as if half-remembered or just obscured by a haze of propriety) to chords that momentarily surround the lyrics and then dissipate again.

Speaking of the lyrics: Pallett got some buzz in 2014 for a [series](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/03/katy_perry_s_teenage_dream_explaining_the_hit_using_music_theory.html) [of](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/03/daft_punk_s_get_lucky_explained_using_music_theory.html) [essays](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/03/lady_gaga_s_bad_romance_owen_pallett_explains_the_pop_diva_s_genius_using.html) in which he analyzed some big recent pop hits using the tools of classical music theory, and that blending of the "high" and "low"-brow continues to be a big part of the appeal of his lyrics too. So you have one of my favorite stanzas of the year, where a philosophical rumination on fame and immortality in the title track pivots abruptly into a crude, cheeky come-on. You have "The Secret Seven"'s blunt rejection of the [It Gets Better](http://www.itgetsbetter.org) mantra in its chorus softened by Pallett's singing of (apparently) his actual phone number and a probaby facetious request that the listener call him if they can't reach their mother. And you have an album that announces its commitment to ambiguity, internal struggle and in-between-ness by having an esoteric gender-neutral pronoun as its fifth word.

I don't have any moments that I'd call standouts from this album because the whole thing's so consistently solid. It's affecting, playful, catchy work from a musician at the top of his game, and the quality also makes it [delightful](http://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/blog/owen-pallett-interview-in-conflict) how [voluble](http://www.npr.org/2014/05/27/314880990/owen-pallett-the-consummate-musician-in-conflict) he is about his creative process and motivating themes. Like its predecessor *Heartland*, *In Conflict* is an album that can grab you immediately and work as background music but also reward any closer inspection you care to undertake.

### Swans, *To Be Kind*. [▶](http://younggodrecords.com/products/to-be-kind) <a href="{{ get_asset('images/covers2014/To Be Kind.jpg')|urlencode }}" title="To Be Kind album cover" rel="bytebox"><img class="albumcover" src="{{ get_asset('images/covers2014/To Be Kind.jpg')|urlencode }}" title="To Be Kind album cover"/></a>

["Oxygen"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jSdTBGhDSg). ["A Little God In My Hands"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2bMsYb9P-k).

I can't write about this album without sounding hyperbolic, so if you haven't heard it you have to just trust that I'm not exaggerating when I say things like "*To Be Kind* grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go for two hours" or "*To Be Kind* is a rollercoaster ride where every car is a steamroller with spikes on it" or the like. Let's say: if you have something distressing on your mind and you would like to blast it out of there as efficiently as possible, you could do worse than spending a couple hours with *To Be Kind* at high volume.

This album has few of the characteristics that usually define my year-end favorites. Its lyrics are "mantric" if you're feeling generous, "perfunctory" if not, and probably something like "asinine" if you're not into it. It has some of what could be called hooks, but its approach to melody ranges from indifferent to hostile, to say nothing of its total disregard for conciseness. In light of that, I guess the easiest way to describe its appeal to me is to say that it is one hundred percent unself-conscious and uninhibited, which inspires a certain vicarious delight in a person like me who is completely the opposite. Is it weird of me to have a secret desire to perform the seventeen-minute "She Loves Us!" at karaoke and have everyone in the room clear out in disgust at its two minutes of wordless gibbering so that Michael Gira and I can shout "YOUR NAME IS FUCK" at the top of our lungs and then follow it up with another nine "FUCK"s in a row without everyone, like, *judging* us about it? Is it weird that that song is supposed to be about sexual abandon but I suspect the force that makes me want to "sing" along to it is impotent rage? Or is it just weird that I think it's germane to admit that in an album review?

*To Be Kind* isn't just two hours of sixty-year-old Michael Gira bellowing inscrutable obscenities. The musicianship—tight enough for a groove like the one in "A Little God In My Hands" but loose enough that when it spills over into cacophony after the first verse you feel it might do so again at any moment—makes those obscenities feel justified. The stamina exemplified by the two solid minutes of pummelling that Swans delivers at the beginning of the thirty-plus-minute "Bring the Sun/Toussaint L'Ouverture" makes them feel *earned*. Put it all together and this album, which on paper seems self-indulgent and gratuitous in the extreme, never feels that way when you're listening to it.

After being underwhelmed by Swans's (superficially quite similar) last effort *The Seer*, I was really surprised at how much I liked *To Be Kind* and how often I still manage to make time to listen to it front to back. It's not the kind of album you cherry pick songs from (with the possible exception of the blistering "Oxygen" or the blaring single "A Little God in My Hands"). It demands a commitment and your full attention but it earns both in spades: when the final onslaught of the title track subsides I feel raw, hypersensitive, scrubbed clean as if by purifying fire.

### Jenny Hval and Susanna, *Meshes of Voice*. [▶](http://susannasonata.com/index.php?view=shop&product=6) <a href="{{ get_asset('images/covers2014/Meshes of Voice.jpg')|urlencode }}" title="Meshes of Voice album cover" rel="bytebox"><img class="albumcover" src="{{ get_asset('images/covers2014/Meshes of Voice.jpg')|urlencode }}" title="Meshes of Voice album cover" /></a>

["Black Lake"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaZo5QK0R4A). ["O Sun O Medusa // A Mirror In My Mouth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfjOWQ3grw0). [Medley (live)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wndJzMYPGFk)

Jenny Hval's 2011 album *Viscera* was one of my favorites that year, but *Meshes of Voice* tops it even as it reprises some of its material. *Viscera*'s black lake reappears here: lyrically in the first and last proper songs, and sonically in the form of floods of distortion, feedback and static that either suffuse the vocals or drown them out entirely. Too much of this would be unlistenable (or perhaps just part of a genre whose charms haven't made themselves known to me yet), but *Meshes* deftly balances the noise with its prettily melodic sections in a way that enriches both.

Over these alternately skeletal and miasmic backing tracks—this was apparently a live performance, which I didn't realize until I heard a cough from an audience member when my listen count was in the double digits—the lyrics take a handful of themes and stretch them thin: honey dew, Medusa, milk, the body. The "Mirror in My Mouth" of track 6 seems to me to loosely describe the album's structure, with "I Have a Darkness" as the suffocating centerpiece across which the aforementioned themes reflect. Basically: the first and last songs *describe* the lake; "I Have a Darkness" *is* the lake.

Conventional descriptions of this album's sound don't seem to do it justice. Some of the melodies could be described as catchy, I guess, but they cling like honey dew rather than in the parasitic way usually associated with the term "earworm". The vocals are uniformly strong and complement each other as well as the title suggests: Susanna Wallumrød has the more "traditional" voice, mellow and warm compared to the sometimes piercing reediness of Jenny Hval's vocals, and she usually sings over piano where Hval favors guitar. Besides the noisy sections I described in my first paragraph, the instrumentation deviates only rarely (and thrillingly) from those two timbres. There's an organ of some kind on "Honey Dew", a splash of drums on "A Sudden Swing"

But the real appeal of this album for me is that it seems full of mysteries—mirrors and depths, skin and bones, water and milk—but reveals a little more of itself every time I listen. It's lovely to skim along its surface and peer into its black depths, but there's enough lake there to submerge myself completely and never reach the bottom.

### Zammuto, *Anchor*. [▶](http://www.zammutosound.com/digital-store) <a href="{{ get_asset('images/covers2014/Anchor.jpg')|urlencode }}" title="Anchor album cover" rel="bytebox"><img class="albumcover" src="{{ get_asset('images/covers2014/Anchor.jpg')|urlencode }}" title="Anchor album cover" /></a>

["Great Equator"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4hbMkcatAY). ["IO"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETMhibbH2bA).

*Anchor* is a graceful album, cohesive and melodic, surprisingly sedate for the impression it leaves on me. Its production is a front to back triumph—particularly the crispy drums—supplementing an emotional and stylistic arc that culminates in what's for my money the most affecting couple of minutes of melancholy of the year.

This album is a sonic delight, and the links in this paragraph will take you to blog entries where you can not only hear the songs but read about how they were made; as an occasional music-making hobbyist myself I find Nick Zammuto's skill in production hugely daunting and impressive. Here are a few of my favorite moments on *Anchor* that he coaxes out of his equipment and his apparently hugely talented collaborators: Those huge synth bass hits behind the verse and the twitchy blips in the interlude of "[Great Equator](http://zammutosound.tumblr.com/post/100053308505/track-2-great-equator)." The tightly reined cacophony that starts and finishes "[Hegemony](http://zammutosound.tumblr.com/post/100127388895/track-3-hegemony)." Those *claps* in "[Electric Ant](http://zammutosound.tumblr.com/post/100423728165/track-7-electric-ant)" and the unstoppable rubbery basslines of "[IO](http://zammutosound.tumblr.com/post/100589131380/track-8-io)" and "[Need Some Sun](http://zammutosound.tumblr.com/post/100290022530/track-5-need-some-sun)". The so, so perfectly maudlin strings that buoy the falsetto in "[Your Time](http://zammutosound.tumblr.com/post/100880488330/track-11-your-time)"'s bridge to even further heights of pathos.

I think my only quibble with this album is that "[Stop Counting](http://zammutosound.tumblr.com/post/100670892145/track-9-stop-counting)" drags a little bit for me, but that's not enough to keep it from being one of my favorites this year. It's gorgeous, enigmatic but not unapproachable, and it packs a great deal of fun and sonic inventiveness into a tidy 40 minutes.

### Adult Jazz, *Gist Is*. [▶](http://adultjazz.bandcamp.com/album/gist-is) <a href="{{ get_asset('images/covers2014/Gist Is.jpg')|urlencode }}" title="Gist Is album cover" rel="bytebox"><img class="albumcover" src="{{ get_asset('images/covers2014/Gist Is.jpg')|urlencode }}" title="Gist Is album cover" /></a>

["Hum"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_AIF9NstTk). ["Am Gone"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2rPHqj-9ss).

I admit, I found out about this album by reading about it on another year-end list. The advantages of having no deadline of one's own, I guess: I can dawdle till February before finishing my list and poach albums from all the people with editors breathing down their necks. Anyway, the poachee in question was [coke machine glow](http://cokemachineglow.com/category/unison-2014/), which used to be my favorite music review site back when they reviewed more than three albums per month, and albums like this one are why.

*Gist Is* is such a hot-and-cold piece of work, like it wants to keep you at arm's length but also pull you in for a hug and can't make up its mind. This is apparent from the very first word of the very first song, after a warm but metallic hum leads us toward Harry Burgess's vocals. They too are round and smooth but almost unsettlingly so: a bit unearthly, maybe, but expressing a very human fear: "The police are gonna wound me / the minister will heal me / but I think he'll do it equally violently."

That striking first line is also one of the most complete thoughts in an album otherwise packed with what often seems like a tangle of lyrical scraps: parenthetical asides, sentence fragments, scat singing, even outright gibberish (that's nontheless faithfully transcribed in the liner notes). So when you get something that sounds like a statement of intent—like when the already-spare instrumentation steps aside about halfway through album centerpiece "[Spook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiMbkn0R-Jw)"—you sit up and take notice. "I write these songs to trick God / and I do not take it lightly" is a line I find delightful enough on its own, but in context on "Spook" it gives me a frisson. And then "Spook" spirals up into one of *Gist Is*'s most anthemic choruses, and when it ends it's followed by the tribal thump and incoherent ululation of "[Idiot Mantra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi3Gp1rrdEQ)". It's a hell of a transition.

I'm focusing on moments from *Gist Is* that tickle me, but the album is almost just a collection of moments. Its nine, mostly longish songs tend to be of the "song suite" variety, which has been one of my favorite formats since the Fiery Furnaces made it a way of life on *Blueberry Boat*. But the instrumentals aren't overstuffed like the Furnaces': there's a pretty minimal rotation of drums, guitar and bass with a dusting of trombone and synth. The sparsity of the arrangements ensures you can always make out each instrument and keeps *Gist Is* sonically cohesive, but never boring, as it hops from idea to idea. The melodies are compelling and hooky as the dickens and Harry Burgess has a powerful and acrobatic voice. This is a splendid album.
