<div class="text">
  <p>Just a few little rooms to tuck my content into, a place to give it a little spit shine when I've got it ready to release into the world. And hopefully it will be a nice kick in my own ass to have these rooms sitting here, every centimeter of available space screaming out to be occupied, walls bare, voice echoing.</p>
