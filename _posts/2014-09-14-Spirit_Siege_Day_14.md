This post is part of the [#25ReasonsToSpiritSiege]({{ get_url('2014/09/01/Spirit_Siege_Day_1/index.html') }}) series. Click that link for a summary!

The nine people working on _Spirit Siege_ are all alumni of the _extremely grueling_<sup id="ref1"><a href="#foot1" class="ref"></a></sup> DigiPen Institute of Technology in Redmond, basically the video game design school _par excellence_ and possibly the most well-known one in the world. Between them, they have worked on nine shipped games that have sold millions of copies on several different platforms. These are people who know how to get stuff done, and if you pledge to their Kickstarter, you can trust that they'll do everything in their considerable power to make sure _Spirit Siege_ lives up to your expectations.

I've watched _Spirit Siege_ go from a reasonably playable but frankly crappy looking game to a more sophisticated and _far_-better looking one in the space of a few months, and that's with a lot of effort diverted to setting up the Kickstarter and getting promotional stuff together for the Penny Arcade Expo. If the Kickstarter funds and the whole team can redirect its efforts to finishing and polishing the actual game, look out.

Let's help the devs make this happen. [Back _Spirit Siege_ on Kickstarter.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix) Everyone who plays it will be able to see what a rad person you are.
