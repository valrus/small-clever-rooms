title: A Crow Looked At Me
tags: [music]
summary: Phil Elverum's latest album as Mount Eerie is an astonishing, tragic, harrowing listen.
---

Every once in a while
a music album comes along that just consumes me for a little while.
I want to read everything anyone's written about it
to find out if it affected other people in the same way it did me
and mine for insights and ways to put words to how it made me feel what I did.
Mount Eerie's [*A Crow Looked at Me*](https://pwelverumandsun.bandcamp.com/album/a-crow-looked-at-me) is the latest such album.
It's about the recent death of Phil Elverum's wife from pancreatic cancer,
and it's not hard to figure out, in broad strokes, why it affected me so powerfully
after only a couple listens.
(It's because it's crushingly sad.)

### It's All Right There In Front Of You

I'm interested in trying to pick apart
how this album is so effective,
because it seems un-pick-apartable.
You go to the album's Genius page<sup id="ref1"><a href="#foot1" class="ref"></a></sup>
and look at the lyrics for the first song, "[Real Death](https://genius.com/Mount-eerie-real-death-lyrics),"
and tell me if you felt the need to click on any of those lyrics
to have user annotations explain what they mean.
The lines that hit the hardest,
like "Real Death" and the first verse of "[Swims](https://genius.com/Mount-eerie-swims-lyrics)",
don't need any, like, exegesis.
It's all right there in front of you.

But I don't think it's as simple as saying *A Crow Looked at Me*
derives its power from being plainspoken about emotional devastation.
Another album from a couple years ago, Sun Kil Moon's *Benji*,
took a similar tack, and I hated it.
It struck me as ham-handed,
an unsubtle attempt to manipulate the listener's emotions
and not worth listening to more than once.
Why bother? There's nothing more to get out of the lyrics.
It's all right there in front of you.

In case my own obvious ham-handedness in the last two paragraphs
didn't make it clear,
my opposite stances on *A Crow Looked at Me* and *Benji* are untenable
in light of my (remarkably similar) attempts to justify them.
So why does *A Crow Looked at Me* work so much better?
Let me excerpt a couple lyrics that highlight the difference
between the approaches taken in these two superficially similar albums.

From *Benji*'s "Pray for Newtown":

> So when Christmas comes and you're out running around  
> Take a moment to pause and think of the kids who died in Newtown  
> They went so young, who gave their lives  
> To make us stop and think and try to get it right  
> They went so young, a cloud so dark over them hung  
> And they left home, gave their mom and dad a kiss and a hug  

From *A Crow Looked at Me*'s "Toothbrush/Trash":

> Today I just felt it for the first time  
> Three months and one day after you died  
> I realized that these photographs we have of you  
> Are slowly replacing the subtle familiar  
> Memory of what it's like to know you're in the other room  
> To hear you singing on the stairs  
> A movement, a pine cone, your squeaking chair  
> The quiet untreasured  
> In between times  
> The actual experience of you here  
> I can feel these memories escaping  
> Colonized by photos narrowed down and told my mind erasing  
> The echo of you in the house dies down  

Looking at the difference between these two excerpts,
I actually hate *Benji* a lot more than I did even the first time I listened to it.
"Pray for Newtown" traffics in generalities and platitudes:
"so young" not once but twice in one stanza, "gave their lives," "a cloud so dark."
It reaches for some kind of moral lesson —
"make us stop and think and try to get it right" —
but again it's so general as to be meaningless.
And when it does deign to offer a concrete look at what it purports to portray,
it feels like naked emotional manipulation (or just an attempt to make the lyrics scan)
rather than an honest decision that those details improve the storytelling.
Of course the kids gave their mom and dad a kiss and a hug before they left for school.
This means nothing. It's just clumsily pawing at my heartstrings.
As my partner aptly put it when I was trying to talk through this post with her,
it's like Mark Kozelek read the Wikipedia entry on the Newtown shooting
and used the information therein to write a song.<sup id="ref2"><a href="#foot2" class="ref"></a></sup>

Contrast "Toothbrush/Trash," of whose lyrics my excerpt comprises about half.
(The stanza I quoted from "Pray for Newtown" is one of nine.)
It's spare, economical with words but generous with details
about the quiet hell Phil Elverum is living.
"Three months and one day after you died."
"You singing on the stairs, a movement, a pinecone, a squeaking chair."
It's every bit as plainspoken as anything on *Benji*,
resorting only to the occasional figure of speech like "colonized by photos"
and "the echo of you in the house."
But Phil Elverum ends lines with words that rhyme
only when he can do so without compromising that straightforwardness,
unlike "Pray for Newtown"'s clumsy "a cloud so dark over them hung."
Elverum has said that an alternate title for *A Crow Looked at Me* could be "Death is Real."
It's a phrase that opens the album, and one he repeats throughout it
as the reality of the death in his life intrudes on him again and again,
making him intolerable to share a grocery aisle with,
crushing him under its weight when he lets his guard down
and dares to imagine a future conversation he might have with his wife.

*A Crow Looked at Me* does a lot with very little.
On first listen, it might seem like it's stream-of-consciousness,
like each song was recorded straight through, one take,
no lyrics written down.
But I can't believe that's the case at all.
The ache I feel listening to this album is too much
for these anecdotes not to have been selected and tweaked for maximum effect,
rather than just plucked haphazardly out of a constant stream of such moments
in Phil Elverum's life and dropped onto an album with no artifice whatsoever.

Please. Please. I have to believe it's not always this bad.

I'm sorry if you listened to <em>Benji</em> and loved it.
I didn't start this post intending to bag on it so hard,
and I know a lot of people thought it was great.
But to me it just seems like dime-store pathos
compared to the realness of the death in <em>A Crow Looked at Me.</em>

And I should be up front about one other factor:
from what I've read, Mark Kozelek seems like he personally is often a
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/04/i-interviewed-mark-kozelek-he-called-me-a-bitch-on-stage">real</a>
<a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1709766/mark-kozelek-i-love-you-but-youre-bringing-me-down/">asshole</a>,
where Phil Elverum seems like just the nicest and most gentle guy you can imagine.
I'm sure this skews my opinion of their artistic output as well,
so feel free to take it with as many grains of salt as you deem necessary.
