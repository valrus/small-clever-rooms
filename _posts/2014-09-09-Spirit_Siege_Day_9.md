Reason number 9 to support Spirit Siege is that its developers are taking a chance on it, having all given up or eschewed paying jobs to pursue something they believe in, burning through their savings or relying on the support of others while they do it. I don't know about you, reader, but I am a guy who values stability and tries to maintain it, and the mere thought of doing something like that alternately fills me with admiration for Nova Heartbeat and gives me the [howling fantods](http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2009/06/word-of-the-week-fantods.html).

This is not necessarily, in itself, a compelling a reason to support _Spirit Siege_, but it spins off several subsidiary reasons:

1. You agree with me that taking a risk like Nova Heartbeat is doing with _Spirit Siege_ is an admirable thing to do, and you want to reward it.
2. Conversely: The thought of people taking a risk like this, having it fail and being forced to go back to whatever they were compelled to leave in the first place fills you with sympathy and you want to prevent it from happening.
3. You recognize that people giving up stability to take a risk on something they're passionate about is basically the essence of the Entreprenurial Spirit that Makes America Great, and you want to help these scrappy underdogs _achieve the American Dream_.
