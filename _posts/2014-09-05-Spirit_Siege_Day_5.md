Currently there are about a dozen different units shown in the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1CgPs3eZXo), but there are certainly plans for a lot more. I'd like to see what they are. I was worried, for a while, that the diversity in the handful of units so far wouldn't stretch too far in such an easy-to-understand game. But thanks to a combination of faith in the designers that devised the game's ingenious mechanic in the first place and a Twitch stream where I got to see their answers to some questions about their plans (and ask a few of my own), I'm now really just excited to see what they'll come up with and at what pace they'll roll it out: both the possible mechanics alluded to in the Twitch stream (spell cards! traps! And so on...) and the consistently clever, [diverse]({{ get_url('2014/09/03/Spirit_Siege_Day_3/index.html') }}) and unique design of the units are things I want to watch as they develop.
