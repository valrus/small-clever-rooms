As a rule, strategy games are either turn-based or played in real-time; indeed, this may be something of a tautology, unless there's a profoundly innovative game out there somewhere that flouts this dichotomy somehow. *Spirit Siege* is not that game; it falls squarely into the real-time camp. But for a real-time game that typically lasts about five minutes, it doesn't feel rushed or frantic. The two clocks that control the accumulation of cards in your hand and the gems you need to play them slow things down a bit and allow you time for deliberation even though there are no turns. It's downtime that won't prolong the game, unless neither you nor your opponent ever plays any cards, in which case what are you even doing.

This is a short one, I guess. I just really like the way _Spirit Siege_'s pacing balances the urgent and the deliberative and I think you should go [back it on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix).
