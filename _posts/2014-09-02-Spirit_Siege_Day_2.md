This post is part of the [#25ReasonsToSpiritSiege]({{ get_url('2014/09/01/Spirit_Siege_Day_1/index.html') }}) series. Click that link for a summary!

I'm pretty into a somewhat (to me) amorphous concept in game design<sup id="ref1"><a href="#foot1" class="ref"></a></sup> known as "elegance." If there's a rigorous, canonical definition of what makes a game elegant, I don't know what it is, but I'm also fairly confident that if such a definition were to exist, mine would be pretty close to it. Personally, I define elegance in a game as the ratio of the amount of interesting decisions it affords to how difficult it is to learn<sup id="ref2"><a href="#foot2" class="ref"></a></sup>.

These are not actual quantifiable measures, of course, and they're fairly (though maybe not absolutely) subjective, which is fine because any evaluation of a game will be subjective. But for me, _Spirit Siege_ fits my definition of elegance to a T. If you haven't already watched the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1CgPs3eZXo), go take a look and see how far in you get before you understand the basic flow of the game. I'm willing to bet that it takes you under a minute, and at that point understanding all the rules is just a matter of learning each unit's abilities<sup id="ref3"><a href="#foot3" class="ref"></a></sup>.

Even with just a couple of those abilities thrown in, the opportunities for tactical decision-making start to get pretty staggering pretty fast. Those opportunities should be catnip to fans of strategy games. I think only once it's been out in the wide world for a while will we be sure whether _Spirit Siege_ has the kind of long-lasting tactical depth my gut tells me it does, but I'd really like to make sure it gets a shot at standing the test of time.

<li class="foot" id="foot2"><p>I'm cribbing a little bit here from <a href="http://keithburgun.net/">Keith Burgun</a>, a <a href="http://alfredmacdonald.com/2013/04/07/leave-burgun-alone/">fairly abrasive person</a> who has nonetheless thought very deeply about game design and come up with some good ideas about what makes games compelling. He defines a game as "a contest of ambiguous decision making," which could have any number of flaws to different people; I'm just using it to show that my measure of "interesting decisions" wasn't my <em>sui generis</em> idea. <a href="#ref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li class="foot" id="foot3"><p>I don't mean to minimize this. There are a lot of different abilities in the game already, and there will be a lot more by the time the game gets to the 100 units it promises to have just by <em>launch</em>, to say nothing of expansions after that. But the rules of those abilities can be learned incrementally, and it may well be possible to play <em>Spirit Siege</em> indefinitely without ever having to learn about any past the base set. In that way, <em>Spirit Siege</em> has the elegance of the modern classic card game <em>Dominion</em>—which has by my count about thirty eight thousand different cards, each of which does something different—but with an even simpler set of base rules. <a href="#ref3">↩</a></p></li>
