My last reason for supporting _Spirit Siege_ is a brief one: the game is already fun, clever and good looking. When they have some funding and another several months to add actual card collection, as well as the other features they've alluded to in backer updates this month; possibly do some serious look-and-feel revamps like I alluded to in my last post; and polish the whole thing to a glossy sheen, I think it will really be a gem. This is a bit of a rehash of my reason [number 5]({{ get_url('2014/09/05/Spirit_Siege_Day_5/index.html') }}), but they've revealed so many more plans since then that the future of _Spirit Siege_ is looking even more exciting now.

They've met their funding goal, but the more they fund, the more able they'll be to go for their stretch goals. [If you haven't already, back them, won't ya?](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix) Thanks for reading!
