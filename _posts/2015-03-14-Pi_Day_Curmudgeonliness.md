Happy Arbitrary Number Of Convenient Yet Also Arbitrary Time Units Elapsed

Whose Divinity, If You're Reading This, You Probably Don't Even Believe In—
Happening to Match Our Physiologically-Based (But Also Arbitrary)
Number System Representation Of
An Actually Fundamental Universal Constant
Day!

Once upon a time
I was enthusiastic about Pi Day,
but I've become a bit of a curmudgeon about it
without even realizing it.
Much of it is due to typical hipster nonsense, probably,
the "I was into math before you posers," kind of thing
when I see like fifty pictures of pies pop up on my Facebook wall.
But my first paragraph sums up my more palatable reason,
which Vi Hart [expounds on at even more length](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E9m6yDEIj8)
with somewhat more verve
but about as much use of the word "arbitrary".

And I think that's what my grumpiness about Pi Day comes down to:
for a day ostensibly about celebrating a mathematical constant
that's remarkable for its timelessness and transcendence
(little [math joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number) there)
of human conventions,
Pi Day sure is contingent on a lot of those conventions.
Pi, as the ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference,
cares not about what number system we use to express it,
or what year it is, or
(I'd claim, as a mathematical [Platonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Platonism))
whether humans or any intelligent life even exist
to know about it and give it a name.
It's just there, and it will always be there.
I don't think I'm irreverent about Pi Day.
I think it's my reverence for pi that makes me feel Pi Day *itself* is irreverent.

Still, though...
it is nice to see the oft-maligned discipline of mathematics get a day in the sun,
however superficial I may find it.
And as a lapsed mathematician
it's unbecoming for me to be too snooty about it.
So despite the arbitrariness of the day,
I wanted to blog about some of the paths that complaining about Pi Day led me down.
This will be very, very digressive and stream-of-consciousness.
But the point is that thinking about Pi Day,
despite its *blatant disrespect* of Pi's sublime universality,
can lead to some interesting
if only tangentially related
(another little [math joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_lines_to_circles) there)
facts and curiousities.
And isn't knowledge what Pi Day should rightly be about?

### Arbitrary Time Units

I started thinking about the arbitrariness of Pi Day's relation to the Judeo-Christian Gregorian calendar
and what more universal and unambiguous metrics it's based on.
I don't think there's anything to be done about the
(to me as a non-Christian)
arbitrariness of Pi Day's being relative to the date of the birth of Jesus Christ
(does this mean that Pi Day should be far more meaningful to Christians,
who attach a profound and universal significance to that date?),
but what about the divisions of time?

Modern science,
which deals in [particles that exist for far less than one-billionth of one billionth of one second](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson),
would not be satisfied with the imprecision in the layperson's definition of a second as
1/31,536,000 of the time it takes for the Earth to revolve around the sun
(or 1/86,400 of the time it takes for it to rotate once).
The difference between any such revolution and the next
is surely long enough for countless Higgs bosons to be created and destroyed.
But the second is a [Système International base unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit).
How is it measured these days
in a way that's good enough for science on this level?

The answer is quite arcane:

> The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.

but it's interesting because of the lengths that people presumably had to go to
in order to ground what we'd *already defined as a second*
in something that doesn't change
every time a comet swings by and tugs something a bit.
And even decades after that definition was cooked up,
it had to be amended
to specify that it refers to the caesium atom *at a temperature of absolute zero*,
because the radiation implied by a nonzero ambient temperature
can affect the above measurement.
In practice, this means no real-world clock can [measure a second](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#Modern_measurements) directly
according to the strict definition.
They have to use whatever temperature they can hold stable
and extrapolate based on that
what the measurement would be at absolute zero.

### How Universal Is Pi?

Looking at the contortions necessary
to make a "second" something that's useful
for high-precision science
got me wondering whether
my understanding of pi is as "universal" as I reverently assume it is.
In particular, our value of 3.14 and so on
is based on a circle in *Euclidean* geometry,
which is characterized by the [axiom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair%27s_axiom)
that given a line *L* and a point *P* not on that line,
there is exactly one line through *P* parallel to *L*.
That seems obvious, 
but in fact you you can instead declare that [there are *no* lines through *P* that parallel *L*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry)
or that there are [*infinitely many* such lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry)
and get [perfectly coherent and even wildly useful systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_non-Euclidean_geometry).

If you make the first of those two assumptions,
you get something called spherical geometry,
called that because things work as if they were all on a sphere.
In spherical geometry, the angles of a triangle add up to *more than* 180 degrees
(or π radians, if you prefer)
and there's no such thing as parallel lines;
*all* lines intersect.
Circles on a sphere look much like they do in "flat" Euclidean geometry,
(although some circles in spherical geometry,
known as "great circles",
are [also lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle))
but if you measure distance along the surface of the sphere,
their circumference-to-diameter ratio is *not* what we know as π!
In fact that ratio is 2
for the great circles
and [gets closer to our π as the circles get smaller](http://blog.plover.com/math/pi.html)!
Under the second assumption,
in hyperbolic geometry,
instead [the ratio is *greater* than our π](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#Circles_and_disks)
(though, again, it gets closer to π
as the circles get smaller
because both hyperbolic and spherical geometry
look like Euclidean geometry if you zoom in real close).

So dang, I should reconsider my position on my high horse.
The only reason I think of pi as "universal"
is that I privilege Euclidean geometry
over the spherical and hyperbolic kind!
There's no compelling *objective* reason
that we should say pi
(defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter)
is approximately 3.14 at all;
instead all we can say is that that's the case
*in Euclidean geometry*.
Pure mathematics
views the three geometries I mention as derived from collections of axioms.
By itself, it [doesn't favor any of them over the others](http://euler.slu.edu/escher/index.php/The_Three_Geometries).
And why should *we* even prefer Euclidean geometry
when we live on a sphere?<sup id="ref1"><a href="#foot1" class="ref"></a></sup>

### Privilege

Realizing that the mathematical constant that I revere
(so much that I smugly look down on those
who celebrate it in a way that I think undercuts its real value)
is actually contingent on a specific geometry
which we designate as "the standard" one
just because it's most convenient to us
is a sort of mathematical "checking my privilege."

[Checking your privilege](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Privilege)
just means to acknowledge the biases
that arise from your personal experience and circumstances
(which may differ hugely from those of other people)
when you think about or discuss an issue.
It's become a sort of shibboleth of the left wing
in American political discourse.
A lot of people think it's primarily a way to shut down conversations
about the kinds of "hot button" topics where privilege is most relevant:
race, class, gender, religious belief, disabilities.
And indeed it can be used that way.
But I think it's a valuable thing
to [be aware of how your life experiences
have been shaped by cultural forces](http://blog.shrub.com/check-my-what/)
and how those experiences
shape your beliefs and assumptions in turn.

In the case of π,
what I thought was a universal and fundamental value
turned out only to be applicable to one specific set of axioms:
axioms which were
(not to put too fine a point on it)
[laid out by a white man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#The_Elements)<sup id="ref2"><a href="#foot2" class="ref"></a></sup> in 300 BC.
Of course I am not proposing that,
had Euclid not been a white man,
we would have discovered non-Euclidean geometry
in less than the two millennia it actually took.
But what if instead of following the paths laid down by a mathematician
who did all his scratchwork on flat surfaces,
we'd had other geometrical prodigies
who used (cylindrical) tree trunks instead?

I follow a lot of disputes about pop culture
and a common argument against adding "diverse" characters to media
is that there's no reason to "change" it
or "try to make a statement."
People who make such arguments assume,
based on privileges that they probably haven't realized they enjoy,
that the straight white male is the *default*
and that using characters who don't fit that mold
is a conscious choice to deviate from that default.
But maybe some people don't fit that demographic
and have different defaults.
Maybe, like with Euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic geometry,
there's not really a good reason to prefer just one of them
and disciplines flourish when they stop pretending there is,
[like geometry did at the beginning of the 19th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry#Discovery_of_non-Euclidean_geometry).

It seems like there are solid reasons to prefer Euclidean geometry,
but it's what we're taught in school,
and the mathematical canon looked at *everything* through that lens
for almost two thousand years.
Maybe math would be further along right now
if we'd given those other geometries more credence
between 300 B.C. and 1800 A.D.
And maybe we'd make more progress faster even today
if we aggressively gave more voice to people
who don't fit in with what people assume is the default.

<p>Actually, I know the reason for this.
It's the same reason that we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics">Newtonian mechanics</a>
for when you throw a ball
rather than relativity or quantum mechanics:
it's a hell of a lot simpler and more familiar,

because, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth">much to the detriment of many B.C. cultures</a>,
a sphere is an awful lot like a flat plane
