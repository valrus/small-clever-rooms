This post is part of the [#25ReasonsToSpiritSiege]({{ get_url('2014/09/01/Spirit_Siege_Day_1/index.html') }}) series. Click that link for a summary!

[Yesterday's reason]({{ get_url('2014/09/11/Spirit_Siege_Day_11/index.html') }}) to support _Spirit Siege_ was the shameless desire for _stuff_ that I know lurks in the heart of every American citizen. Today's is the same, but the stuff is of the virtual variety. If your house or apartment is full of things already, or if you're a collectible card gamer who likes to fine-tune your deck until it's just a _machine_, this reason is for you. When _Spirit Siege_ becomes available, it will come with a few cards, but in order to get enough to make a deck that you can really call your own, you'll have to buy some more so you can start making those hard, fun deck-building decisions. Decisions like:

* Should I have a bunch of different units, or multiples of a few units?
* What happens if I make a deck with all units that cost less than 25 gems?
* How can I maximize having units that shoot past other units to create a horrifyingly effective death chain?
* Can I make a deck with just dragons? Aww, why not?<sup id="ref1"><a href="#foot1" class="ref"></a></sup> Okay, how about just dragons _and bears_?

Fund at the $20 level and you can get all the common cards when the game launches; a hundo will get you one of every card, common or not; high rollers can spend a few Gs and get one of _every card, forever_. I suspect that offer won't even exist after the game is released.

[You'd better snap it up now by supporting _Spirit Siege_ on Kickstarter.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix)
