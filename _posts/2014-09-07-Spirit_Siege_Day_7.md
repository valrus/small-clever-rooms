This post is part of the [#25ReasonsToSpiritSiege]({{ get_url('2014/09/01/Spirit_Siege_Day_1/index.html') }}) series. Click that link for a summary!

[The fifth reason]({{ get_url('2014/09/05/Spirit_Siege_Day_5/index.html') }}) to support _Spirit Siege_ was its broad potential for expandability. Today's reason (following on [yesterday's]({{ get_url('2014/09/05/Spirit_Siege_Day_5/index.html') }})) is that that expandability is totally optional. It's a counterpoint! _Spirit Siege_ is a rich tapestry. It's the end of week 1 of [#25ReasonsToSpiritSiege](https://twitter.com/hashtag/25ReasonsToSpiritSiege?src=hash) and I'm getting loopy.

When _Spirit Siege_ is released, you'll be able to start collecting cards if you want, but you don't _have_ to. Its games are [pretty interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1CgPs3eZXo) to play or watch even now, in the pre-alpha with its preconstructed decks containing only a dozen or so units. When it's actually released, you can dive into the pile of new cards that will exist by that point and start putting together your own Ã¼ber-deck! But you can also just... not. One of the goals of the devs is to keep _Spirit Siege_ fun even if you don't spend any money on it (but, of course, to _tempt_ you with new and exciting but optional units that you _can_ spend money on).

Can you resist temptation? There's only one way to find out: [back their Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix)!
