You know what? I've been doing this for a week. I'm taking a little break for today. Reason number 8 to support _Spirit Siege_ is that one of the units is a princess who shoots cake. [Didn't I tell you _Spirit Siege_ was unique?]({{ get_url('2014/09/01/Spirit_Siege_Day_1/index.html') }})

Here is a mini-strategy guide that my partner created today about how to deploy the Prudent Princess. Clicking it will take you to the _Spirit Siege_ Kickstarter, now that I've piqued your interest.

Note: The cake is not a [Portal](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-cake-is-a-lie) joke. It is an (apocryphal) [Marie Antoinette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_them_eat_cake) joke. Reason 8.5: _Spirit Siege_ is classy. [Back their Kickstarter, and you become classy yourself](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix).
