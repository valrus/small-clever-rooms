This post is part of the [#25ReasonsToSpiritSiege]({{ get_url('2014/09/01/Spirit_Siege_Day_1/index.html') }}) series. Click that link for a summary!

The [1st]({{ get_url('2014/09/01/Spirit_Siege_Day_1/index.html') }}) and [2nd]({{ get_url('2014/09/02/Spirit_Siege_Day_2/index.html') }}) reasons to support _Spirit Siege_ were gameplay-centric, but in the midst of some turmoil and upheaval in the "gamer" community, I think it's also important to take a step back and look at some other values that _Spirit Siege_ espouses even though they have little to do with the gameplay. The one that you can immediately see just from looking at <a href="{{ get_asset('images/posts/Spirit_Siege/Spirit_Siege_Banner.jpg') }}" rel="bytebox">promotional art</a>, and the one I'm featuring today, is that the characters are diverse.

I feel that diversity of representation is a pretty important thing for games to strive for, but as a member of the most privileged and well-represented class in America, my reasons for it are largely second-hand or based on things I've read<sup id="ref1"><a href="#foot1" class="ref"></a></sup> from people better-positioned to comment on it. So I apologize if I come at this like it's an abstraction, but to me, it is. For a lot of other people, it's really not. 

It can be hard to find your way into a community based around a type of media when you feel marginalized within that medium. [There's a case to be made](http://www.jacehallshow.com/news/gaming/industry/20130121/care-diversity-gaming/)<sup id="ref2"><a href="#foot2" class="ref"></a></sup> that gaming's "defaulting" of the straight white male (and frequent stereotyping or sidelining of everyone else) can make people who don't fit that description feel like gaming isn't _for_ them. _Spirit Siege_'s character design takes a shot at that paradigm: everyone is welcome and valuable on this battlefield.

In a way, _Spirit Siege_'s character diversity is shallow: characters don't (at the moment!) have rich and diverse backgrounds, because none of them really have stories at all. But it also doesn't feel like an afterthought or like they started adding in female or characters of color when they ran out of white dudes. Of the maybe 15 character designs that I've seen, I think 4 or 5 fit that latter description. _Spirit Siege_'s commitment to diversity is pervasive, not something that's tacked on as a bonus after the "real content" is done.

This satisfies my high-minded ideals, but it's also a savvy business strategy. The fine folks at Nova Heartbeat who were running the booth at the Penny Arcade Expo told me that their promotional mini-cards featuring the <a href="{{ get_asset('images/posts/Spirit_Siege/Prudent_Princess.jpg') }}" rel="bytebox">Prudent Princess</a> character were popular among the kind of young women who might be assumed to watch Disney movies, and that's awesome. How many deep strategy games have art designed to draw in that demographic? How many women are there who might be world-class strategy gamers now if they'd had such a game that appealed to them when they were 11? How many other people could be drawn into Spirit Siege because it has a character who looks like them?
