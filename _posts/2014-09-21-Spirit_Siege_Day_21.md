Today's reason to support Spirit Siege is yet another good gameplay idea, one that provides the capacity for amazing comebacks and clever alternate playstyles as well as solving a problem I didn't even realized was a problem.

That problem, which happens with a lot of games, is that it's easy for an early lead to snowball into a game whose result is a foregone conclusion halfway in. The early lead creates circumstances that benefit the player who's already winning, making any kind of comeback more and more unlikely. This turns the game into a slog for both players, as the winner is forced to go through the motions and the loser faces an increasingly hopeless situation.

*Spirit Siege*'s designers are aware of this problem and they recently revealed plans for a new mechanic to thwart it. It's simple: having your (first two of three) crystals be destroyed increases your resources to defend the remaining ones. It's a bit like the overpowered items you can get when you're doing badly in *Mario Kart* in the way it can turn a match around, but it's less drastic, hopefully less annoying to the other player, and takes some actual skill to use. (Infamous blue shells, I'm looking at you here.)

As with much of the rest of *Spirit Siege*, the precise details of this mechanic are still in flux, but even in its skeletal state, it's plain to see how it can solve or at least ameliorate many of the problems I described in the beginning of this post without adding substantially to the game's overall complexity. The thing is, I wasn't even consciously aware of those problems before I heard about this new mechanic, and now I see how many of the games I enjoy have them. Is there anyone who hasn't experienced the feeling, partway through a game, that they have no chance but that to forfeit wouldn't be sporting?  It always seemed to me like it was just a risk you take when playing a game. But maybe it's actually something that can be mitigated by better game design.

I think it's worth [taking a chance on *Spirit Siege*](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix) in order to find out.
