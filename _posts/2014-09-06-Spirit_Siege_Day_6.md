Ah, free-to-play games. Exciting new paradigms and revenue models in gaming that lead to some truly [atrocious](http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=1076) and [exploitative](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-endless-shopper-burning-money-in-temple-run-2-candy-crush-saga-and-little-inferno/) video games! [Here, if you're interested, is a long, interesting, amusing/terrifying article](http://insertcredit.com/2011/09/22/who-killed-videogames-a-ghost-story/) about the diabolical machinations employed by many free-to-play games to manipulate your psychology in order to hook you and get your money.

What is my point in all this? _Spirit Siege_ says—and I want to believe it—that free-to-play games don't have to be this way. You don't have to wait for your "energy" to recharge; you can play it anytime. You can't (if the game's designers have anything to say about it, which one hopes they do) buy cards that will enable you to coast to an easy victory over your opponent, no matter how much you spend (or how much they _didn't_ spend).

If you read the link on the word "exploitative" above, you'll see that at the end of it, [Tevis Thompson](http://tevisthompson.com/) (one of my favorite and most assertive video game writers) talks about how important _trust_ is to gaming. Time will tell, of course, whether _Spirit Siege_'s company [Nova Heartbeat](http://www.novaheartbeat.com/about/) is trustworthy. Based on my interactions with its people, I trust that Nova Heartbeat is focusing on trying to make a game that will _earn_ your money by being well-designed and accessible and offering you interesting content, rather than _extorting_ it out of you by telling you that you can't play it until you pay, or backing you into a corner where you can't progress without paying. Simply put: they are putting their effort into making _Spirit Siege_ a good game. They want your money, sure. But they want to you to agree that they _deserve_ it.

If you think they might deserve it, or you want to give them a chance to earn your trust, [here's their Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix).
