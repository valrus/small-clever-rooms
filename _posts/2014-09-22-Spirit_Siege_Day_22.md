The 22nd reason to support Spirit Siege is that it will allow plenty of different styles of play, despite its simplicity. It's kind of hard to see this from the gameplay videos currently in existence, with their symmetric, perfunctory decks created from the handful of cards that have been implemented so far, but we can speculate based on some things we know are planned.

First off, obviously there will be a lot more cards by the time *Spirit Siege* is ready for release, so you'll be able to construct a deck which is more focused, or perhaps more whimsical, than the generic ones being used for demonstrations so far. There will be some limitations on the decks you can build--a minimum deck size without too many duplicates--but you can expect a lot more possibilities for making the kind of deck you want, be it a fun one containing only non-humans or the most overpowered one you can come up with.

Also, though, a recently devised mechanic that gives you advantages when your own crystals are destroyed could lead to a whole different class of decks that use it intentionally to achieve dramatic comebacks. I can imagine a deck that sacrifices one crystal while securing good positions for defending the other two, then uses the boost from the destroyed crystal along with that positional head start to become a powerhouse in the late game. It would be tricky to pull off, maybe, but my point is that *Spirit Siege* will support this kind of trickery in addition to more straightforward approaches. I always enjoyed making tricky, wiseass decks in my _Magic: The Gathering_ days. They're behind me now but I look forward to recapturing a little of that fun in _Spirit Siege_.

Of course, there's another option, which is to just play the game without getting all egghead about customizing your decks. Even with the stock deck, it's just as brisk and clever as many of my previous 21 posts have indicated. So you can be a totally "casual" _Spirit Siege_ player and that's just as legitimate as getting totally into it.
