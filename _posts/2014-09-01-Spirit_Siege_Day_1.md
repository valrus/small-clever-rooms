summary: For the month of September, this blog is an unofficial and unapologetic marketing vehicle for a mobile real-time strategy game.

For several months my partner has been doing art, design and other work for a combination real time strategy/collectible card game called _Spirit Siege_. It's [Kickstarting](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix) right now until September 26, and I'd like to see it succeed not just because of my personal interest in my partner's success but also because I think it's a really clever and worthy game.

To that end, I'm devising 25 reasons you should support _Spirit Siege_, and I'll be posting one per day on this blog from now until the day before the Kickstarter finishes. After that, I'll go back to my regular bimonthly posting schedule.

First, the game in a nutshell: _Spirit Siege_ will have you build a deck of cards representing combat units and use them to place those units on a battlefield like the one on the right in order to defend your crystals and destroy your opponent's. You have a single resource (provisionally called "mana" like in _Magic: The Gathering_) and a hand of up to 5 cards with different abilities and mana costs, and your mana and the cards in your hand both replenish at a constant rate. That's all there is to the basic rules, but the units have many different abilities when you drop them on the field. There's a demo video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1CgPs3eZXo">here</a><sup id="ref1"><a href="#foot1" class="ref"></a></sup> which shows a full game being played and demonstrates some of those abilities.

With that in hand, the first of my 25 reasons that you should support _Spirit Siege_ is:

### 1. There's no other game quite like it.

There are lots of real time strategy games (like _StarCraft_ and _Age of Empires_) and plenty of collectible card games (e.g. _Magic: The Gathering_, _Pokémon_) but if there are any games that combine the two in the way _Spirit Siege_ does, I'm not aware of them. Most collectible card games are turn-based rather than real-time; few if any RTSes have the kind of deck-building metagame that _Spirit Siege_ does. So I'm excited about _Spirit Siege_ because it combines some familiar game mechanics to make a brisk, exciting game that doesn't feel exactly like anything that's come before it.
