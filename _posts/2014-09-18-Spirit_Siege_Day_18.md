Today's reason to support _Spirit Siege_, the seventeenth, is kind of a long shot. It would be like saying that you should buy a lottery ticket because you could win the lottery, if you were to disregard the 24 other reasons in this series that are somewhat more likely to pan out. The reason is that there's a non-zero probability that _Spirit Siege_ will be the next _Magic: The Gathering._

I frankly think that _Spirit Siege_ is _much_ better designed than _Magic: The Gathering_. I don't think that's putting its designers on a pedestal; _Magic_ has been around for like two decades, game design has come kind of a long way since then, and I think _Spirit Siege_ does a good job of capitalizing on that in addition to its own clever ideas. It's easier to learn, very unlikely to have the insane agglutination of errata and edge cases that _Magic_ does, and as I detailed (and detailed, and detailed) in my [last post]({{ get_url('2014/09/17/Spirit_Siege_Day_17/index.html') }}), it's unlikely to have the kind of pattern _Magic_ can where some combo becomes a guaranteed win and it has to get nerfed to oblivion or banned in tournaments.

So I don't think it's completely impossible to imagine _Spirit Siege_ becoming a huge sensation like _Magic_ is now. Don't get me wrong. The market for games of all kinds is super crowded these days, far more than it was when _Magic_ showed up, and it would be wildly optimistic to think that the scenario I depict here is _likely_. But sometimes it's fun to indulge our wild optimism.
