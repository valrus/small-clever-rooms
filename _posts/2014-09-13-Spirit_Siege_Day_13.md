This post is part of the [#25ReasonsToSpiritSiege]({{ get_url('2014/09/01/Spirit_Siege_Day_1/index.html') }}) series. Click that link for a summary!

Over the last two days I appealed to your [materialism]({{ get_url('2014/09/11/Spirit_Siege_Day_11/index.html') }}) and your [competitiveness]({{ get_url('2014/09/11/Spirit_Siege_Day_11/index.html') }}) as reasons to support _Spirit Siege_. Today, I target your vanity.

I speak, of course, of the kind of vanity that will make a person pay $20, $50 or $100 for a special Kickstarter-exclusive avatar icon that will let all the Johnny-come-latelies know that person was in on _Spirit Siege_ before it got cool. The kind of vanity that, in more advanced stages, might put that person out $1,500 to design their own unit for inclusion in the game, or even larger amounts to have their name listed in a prominent location in the game's credits. It's okay, this is a harmless kind of vanity. You don't need to be ashamed of it. Everyone wants their name in lights.

[Indulge that harmless vanity by supporting _Spirit Siege_ on Kickstarter.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix) Everyone who plays it will be able to see what a rad person you are.
