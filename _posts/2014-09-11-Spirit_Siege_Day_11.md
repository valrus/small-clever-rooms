After attempting to appeal to your high-minded ideals in my [9th reason]({{ get_url('2014/09/09/Spirit_Siege_Day_9/index.html') }}) to support _Spirit Siege_, I now turn my attention to all that is base and acquisitive in you. You should toss some ducats at the _Spirit Siege_ Kickstarter because of the assorted rare and attractive baubles and trinkets you can get in return. Perhaps _Spirit Siege_, due to its clever design and clear accessibility, will become an international sensation and the <a href="{{ get_asset('images/posts/Spirit_Siege/Tshirt.jpg') }}" rel="bytebox">T-shirts</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/568/821/36bba690a1575108647a66f2661f0be1_large.png?1410447128" rel="bytebox">posters</a> and <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/568/822/b606b55a5cad56af3810f8ffd33f5d90_large.png?1410447141" rel="bytebox">buttons</a> you can pick up for a pittance now will end up highly valuable collector's items. Perhaps you haven't yet managed to _completely_ cover your MacBook in stickers that no one else has, and these ones are as good as any. Perhaps you just like the cute characters.

You can tack on any swag for a little extra, no matter what "level" you pledge at. It's a bit unconventional for Kickstarter, but making bold, unconventional decisions is part of what the folks at Nova Heartbeat are about. (The other part is making sure those bold decisions are transparent, which is why they have prepared a [guide](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix/posts/974330) explaining how to get yourself an add-on.)

Satisfy your secret lust for cool things. [Support _Spirit Siege_ on Kickstarter.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix)
