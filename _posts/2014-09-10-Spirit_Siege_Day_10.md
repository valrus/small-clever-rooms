A common problem with mobile games is that the interface sucks. Some try to simulate console-style gamepad controls on a touchscreen, which is unpleasant when you lack the tactile buttons of a real gamepad. Some expect an unreasonable amount of precision in your ability to touch a screen with a finger that is imprecise by nature and inflict dire consequences on you if you miss your target. There are a lot of ways to get touchscreen interfaces either blatantly or subtly wrong, and many of them result from taking things that were reasonable, say, with a mouse or gamepad, and trying to make them work the same way on a touchscreen.

In my (somewhat limited, but probably in the top 20 humans on Planet Earth) experience, _Spirit Siege_ doesn't botch its interface in this way; it was designed from the ground up with mobile in mind, and it shows. Playing requires one action: drag from your hand of cards onto the playing field. There's a clear but tasteful crosshair so you don't have to worry about your finger obscuring the field so you can't see where you'll drop the unit. The biggest risk is lifting your finger too early. It just works, and in the end the interface is completely transparent, like all the best interfaces are.

[Here's _Spirit Siege_'s Kickstarter, for fans of good, solid, straightforward interfaces.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1796662059/spirit-siege-your-five-minute-strategy-game-fix) But I refuse to refer to it as "buttery-smooth" as they do there. On this blog, I have _standards_.
